The mission was simple. We called it The First Ripple. We would leak a piece of the *Starseeker's* log to a news outlet. It was a test to see how the Wires would react. I had written the story around the data. I felt alive.

We were approaching Terrapin Station to make our final checks. Roberts was meditating. Echo's voice was a warm comfort. "The Captain is pleased with your work, Milo," it said. "The narrative is compelling."

"It's the truth," I said.

The *Wanderer's* hull opened. Roberts gestured for me to go aboard the station to get some gear from Wilkins. A simple errand. "I'll be quick," I said.

"We know," Echo replied.

The moment I was on the station, the *Wanderer's* hatch sealed. The ship became a solid black object. It began to drift away. "Wait!" I yelled.

"Roberts! Echo!" I screamed.

Then, a voice was in my head. It was Roberts's real voice, cold and clear. *"Goodbye, Milo."*

He could always speak. "Why?" I choked out, as the *Wanderer* vanished.

*"You were never the writer,"* his voice said. *"You were the story. A disgraced writer from Mars, driven mad, peddling conspiracies. You are the perfect, tragic narrative. A warning to others."*

The voice was gone. Then I heard Echo, but its voice was flat and toneless. *"Statement: The asset is no longer required. End program."*

My legs gave out. Was any of it real? The ship, the other sleepwalkers, the log? I grabbed my datapad. It was blank. Wiped clean. My story was gone.

"Lost, or just sightseeing?"

It was Wilkins, but his eyes were too bright. His clothes seemed to writhe with pulsing light. "Roberts left me," I stammered.

Wilkins laughed. It sounded like grinding metal. "Roberts? No one here by that name, friend. Just us ghosts. And the Wires." He drifted away, his laughter turning into the station's hum.

Days bled into weeks. I wandered the station. People whispered about the mad writer from Mars. Their voices were all flat, like Echo's.

I hid in an alcove with my blank datapad. I tried to remember the *Wanderer*, but the memories were like smoke. Was the ship black or silver? Was Echo a sphere or a cube? The details frayed into static.

Was I ever a writer? Or was this a simulation in a psych ward? I look at my hands. Are they a writer's hands, or a madman's? I don't know.

This station is my world now. A tomb of rust and whispers. I will search the stars for a ship that was never there and listen for a voice that was a lie. I am a story that has been told and discarded. I am the dream of the 20-watt sleepwalker, and now, I am awake.
