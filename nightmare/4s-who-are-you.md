We drifted in the quiet between walks. I had questions for Roberts, but I asked Echo. "On Mars, we get news feeds," I said. "Earth, Luna, and Mars all say different things. We don't know who to trust."

"Trust is a heavy word," Echo replied. "The Captain believes in signals, not shared truths. Earth signals authority. Luna signals independence. Mars signals prosperity. The stations signal survival."

"And the sleepwalkers?" I asked.

"None," Echo said. "We do not transmit. We listen. We've learned those signals are just noise. Propaganda. They are all shouting so loudly they can't hear anything else."

The sphere drifted closer to the view of the colonies. "The Captain believes independence isn't choosing a side. It's realizing the sides are an illusion."

"So he trusts no one?"

"He trusts individuals," Echo corrected. "He trusts Wilkins. He trusts the other sleepwalkers. He trusted you." The sphere's blue lens focused on me. "The question he asks is not who you trust, Milo. It is, 'Who are you?'"

The question hung in the air. I looked at my dark datapad. I was a writer. But what if the stories I told were a cage?

"The Wires control the signals," I said, the idea forming. "The news, the ads... they filter everything."

"They are good at their job," Echo confirmed.

A new thought struck me. "They control distribution," I said. "But not creation." My purpose became clear. I had to tell the story the Wires were erasing. My datapad was a weapon.

"I'm a writer," I said again, but the words felt different. "I know who I am now."

Echo's blue lens seemed to brighten. I felt Roberts's attention shift from the stars to me.
