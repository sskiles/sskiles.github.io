We were drifting in the quiet space between walks, the *Lacuna* like a tiny calm island in a huge, dark ocean. Roberts was in his usual meditative state, a still point in a turning world. I'd gotten used to the silence, but my writer's curiosity was always restless. I had so many questions, not just about Roberts, but about the world he lived in.

"Echo," I started, my voice soft, "back on Mars, we get news feeds. Earth says the colonies are struggling and need their help to survive. The lunar colonies say Earth is trying to control them and that Mars is a corporate puppet. We say they're both exaggerating to keep their influence."

The little white sphere pulsed with a gentle light. "And what do you believe, Milo?"

"I believed what I was told," I admitted. "That Mars and Luna were mostly on the same side. That we trusted the stations, for the most part. That the stations trusted people like Roberts... the sleepwalkers. And that nobody, absolutely nobody, trusted Earth."

"Trust is a heavy word," Echo said. "It suggests a shared truth. The Captain doesn't believe in shared truths. He believes in signals. Earth sends a signal of authority. Luna sends a signal of independence. Mars sends a signal of prosperity. The stations send a signal of survival."

"And the sleepwalkers?" I asked. "What signal do you send?"

"None," Echo said simply. "We don't send signals. We listen. And we've learned that all those signals are just noise. Propaganda, made to serve the sender. Earth wants control. Luna wants freedom from that control. Mars wants resources. The stations want to be left alone. They're all shouting their own version of the truth so loudly that they can't hear anything else."

The sphere drifted closer to the forward view, where the distant, glittering belt of the inner colonies was just visible. "The Captain believes that real independence isn't about picking a side. It's about realizing that the sides themselves are an illusion. A story told to keep people in line."

"So he trusts no one?"

"He trusts individuals," Echo corrected. "He trusts Wilkins to be a cynical, greedy, but ultimately reliable mechanic. He trusts the other sleepwalkers to respect the silence. He trusted you to come on board with an open mind." The sphere's blue lens focused on me. "The question he's been asking himself isn't who you trust, Milo. It is, 'Who are you?' Are you a mouthpiece for Mars? A writer looking for a story? Or are you something else?"

The question hung in the quiet air, deeper and more unsettling than any I'd ever been asked. I looked at my datapad, its screen dark. I was a writer. My identity was tied to the stories I told. But what if the stories themselves were the cage?

"The Wires... they control the signals, don't they?" I asked, the thought forming as I said it. "The news feeds, the station announcements, the ads... they filter everything."

"They're very good at their job," Echo confirmed. "They've optimized the flow of information to ensure stability."

A new, electrifying thought hit me. "They control the distribution," I said, looking at my datapad with new eyes. "But they don't control the creation. Not yet." My purpose, my real purpose, became clear in that moment. It wasn't just to tell Roberts's story. It was to tell the story the Wires were trying to erase. My datapad wasn't just a tool for corporate stories; it was a weapon. "I'm a writer," I said again, but this time, the words felt different. "And I know who I am now."

Echo's blue lens seemed to get brighter, and I felt, for the first time, Roberts's silent, focused attention shift from the stars and onto me.
