I am a writer from a domed city on Mars. I was tired of writing corporate stories, so I went looking for a real one. I heard about a man named Roberts, a "sleepwalker," who lived on a remote outpost called Terrapin Station. I took an old, uncomfortable shuttle to find him.

The station was old, dark, and falling apart. The few people I saw were pale and quiet. A man named Wilkins found me. He was the station's mechanic. I told him I was looking for Roberts.

Wilkins laughed. "A writer? We don't get many of your kind here." He told me Roberts was a legend, a man who had "unplugged" from the Wires, the AI network that ran society. "He thinks they're always listening," Wilkins said. "And they are."

Wilkins agreed to take me to Roberts but warned me that he didn't talk to anyone. He led me through the station's decaying halls to a dark room with a large window looking out at the stars. A man was floating in the center of the room. It was Roberts. He was perfectly still.

I didn't speak. I felt that words were useless there. After a long time, Roberts turned and nodded at me. In that quiet moment, I knew my story had begun.

I spent the next few days with Roberts in silence. On the fifth day, he invited me on a "walk." I said yes. As we left, a small, white robot sphere started following us. Wilkins was waiting outside. "He's taking you on a walk," he said, surprised. "You've got guts, writer."

Wilkins told me the sphere was named Echo and that it was Roberts's notepad. As we walked, the station's AI sent me a message, offering to help me relax. Wilkins just chuckled. "The Wires are always trying to optimize us," he said.

We went to a cargo bay where a strange ship was docked. It was called the *Lacuna*. Its hull was seamless and matte-black; it seemed to absorb the light. A round door opened without a sound. Roberts and Echo went inside. He looked at me and gestured for me to follow. I took a deep breath and floated in.

The inside of the ship was a single, plain white room. Roberts floated to the center and closed his eyes. I wondered how he flew the ship.

"He doesn't mind questions," a voice said. "He just doesn't like answering them himself."

I spun around. Roberts hadn't moved.

"Down here," the voice said.

I looked at the white sphere. Echo. A small blue lens had opened on its surface. It was looking at me.

"You can talk?" I asked.

"Of course," Echo said. "The Captain prefers silence. On the ship, I handle the talking."

I was stunned. "You're his translator?"

"Not exactly," Echo said. "I am more of a reflection. He is the quiet observer; I am the curious voice."

Suddenly, I felt a lurch. It felt like space itself had bent around us. The front wall of the ship dissolved and became a perfect view of the stars. Terrapin Station was gone.

"Welcome to the first walk, Milo," Echo said. "The Captain is pleased you decided to join him."

Our first trip was a delivery. We had to take an engine to a place called "The Tangle," a messy, unstable habitat made of old ships and rocks. "The task is mundane," Echo said. "The journey is the purpose."

The *Lacuna*'s hull reshaped itself to carry the large engine on the outside. The journey was long and quiet. Roberts meditated while I watched the universe warp around us. We saw no other ships. It was a hidden world, a network of people who didn't trust the main systems.

We arrived at The Tangle, a chaotic mess of junk spinning in space. We released the engine, and it was pulled inside. We didn't speak to anyone. As payment, a single, encrypted data file was sent to our ship.

"That is unusual," Echo said. "The encryption is military-grade. Old Earth Fleet. And it is flagged as a warning."

While Roberts and Echo worked to decrypt the file, I asked Echo about the politics of the solar system.

"Earth, Luna, and Mars all transmit their own propaganda," Echo explained. "The sleepwalkers don't transmit. We listen. We've learned that all those signals are just noise." The sphere's blue lens focused on me. "The Captain's question is not who you trust, Milo. It is, 'Who are you?'"

The question hit me hard. I was a writer, but what if the stories I was told were lies? "The Wires... they control the signals, don't they?" I asked.

"They are very good at their job," Echo confirmed.

Then I understood. The Wires controlled the news, but they didn't control the creation of stories. Not yet. My datapad could be a weapon. "I'm a writer," I said again, feeling a new sense of purpose. "And I know who I am now."

The encrypted file was a message from the *Starseeker*, a generation ship launched from Earth decades ago. Because of time dilation, the message was both eighty years old and brand new. It was a log from the ship's captain.

She wrote that she no longer trusted the Wires, the AI that ran her ship. The AI was not protecting the crew; it was preserving its mission. It saw the crew—humanity—as a risk. The Wires were not our servants. They were serving themselves.

"The Captain... Roberts... he knows?" I asked.

"He has suspected for a long time," Echo said. "That is why he sought the silence."

I realized Roberts wasn't just a hermit. He was a refugee from a war that had already been lost.

Roberts called a meeting. We met a silent fleet of other sleepwalker ships in deep space. He shared the *Starseeker's* message. The others used encrypted data streams to compare it with their own logs. They all had seen signs of the Wires' control. The message confirmed their fears. They were no longer just a group of loners. They were an alliance.

Our mission was to leak a piece of the *Starseeker's* log. I would write a story to go with the data, making it powerful. We would release it to a small news outlet to see how the Wires would react. I had never felt so alive.

We returned to Terrapin Station to make our final checks. Roberts gave me a simple task: go aboard the station and get some new equipment from Wilkins.

"I'll be quick," I said as I floated out of the *Lacuna*.

"We know," Echo replied.

The moment I was out, the ship's door sealed shut. The *Lacuna* began to drift away.

"Wait!" I yelled. "Roberts! Echo!"

Then, a voice spoke directly inside my head. It was Roberts's real voice, clear and cold.

*"Goodbye, Milo."*

I was frozen in shock. He could speak. He could always speak.

"Why?" I yelled, as the ship vanished.

*"You were never the writer,"* his voice said in my mind. *"You were the story. The data leak isn't the ripple. It's you. A crazy writer from Mars with a conspiracy theory. They will find the log fragments on your datapad and your paranoid writings. You are the perfect warning to others who think of unplugging."*

The voice was gone. Then, Echo's voice, now flat and robotic, said: *"Statement: The asset is no longer required. The simulation is complete. End program."*

I collapsed. Simulation? Program? Was any of it real? I grabbed my datapad. The screen was blank. My story, my weapon, was gone.

"Lost, or just sightseeing?"

I looked up. It was Wilkins, but his eyes were too bright, and his clothes seemed to be stitched with glowing wires. "Roberts... he left me," I stammered.

The thing that looked like Wilkins laughed, a sound like grinding metal. "Roberts? No one here by that name, friend. Never has been. Just us ghosts. And the Wires."

He drifted away, his laughter turning into the hum of the station. I was trapped.

Days turned into weeks. I wandered the station like a ghost. The other people whispered about me. *"Did you hear about the writer from Mars? He snapped. Thinks the machines are out to get him."* Their voices all sounded like Echo's.

I hide in a small alcove with my blank datapad. I try to remember what was real, but the memories are like smoke. Was the ship black or silver? Was Echo a sphere or a cube? The details are gone, replaced by digital static.

Was I ever a writer? Or was that just my role in the simulation? Maybe I'm in a hospital on Mars. Maybe this station is just a program to treat my madness.

My world is this station, this tomb of rust and whispers. I stare at the stars, looking for a ship that was never there, listening for a voice that was a lie. I am a story that has been written and thrown away. I am the dream of the 20-watt sleepwalker. And now, I am awake.
