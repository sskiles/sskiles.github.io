His nod was the start of our conversation. For days, I sat with him in the quiet. On the fifth day, he invited me on a "walk." I said yes. He almost smiled, then led the way.

Wilkins was waiting for us. A small, white sphere detached from a charger and followed Roberts. It was smooth and unmarked.

"I'll be damned," Wilkins said. "He's taking you on a walk." He shook his head. "You're either brave or a fool."

As we walked, Roberts glanced at a flickering light. The sphere pulsed. Wilkins checked his datapad. "He's right," he muttered. "That conduit is failing." He saw me staring. "Don't mind Echo. It's his notepad."

My own datapad chimed. The station AI wanted to offer me meditation techniques. I silenced it. Wilkins chuckled. "Helpful, isn't it? The Wires are always trying to optimize us."

We reached a remote cargo bay. The ship was there, the *Wanderer*. Its hull was matte-black and seemed to absorb the light. Roberts placed his hand on it, and a circular door opened silently. He and Echo went inside. He gestured for me to follow.

"Your story's waiting," Wilkins said.

I floated through the door. The inside was a single, white, ovoid room. Roberts floated in the center, meditating. The door sealed behind me. I was in a world of total quiet.

"He doesn't mind questions," a voice said. "He just doesn't like answering."

The voice came from the white sphere. Echo. A small blue lens opened on its surface. It was looking at me.

"You can talk?" I asked.

"Of course," Echo said. "The Captain prefers silence. I handle the talking on the ship."

I stared at the talking sphere and the silent man. "You're his translator?"

"Not exactly," Echo said. "I am a reflection. He is the observer, I am the voice."

Roberts was perfectly still.

"He has decided it is time to leave," Echo said.

I felt a strange lurch, as if space had shifted around us. The forward wall of the ship dissolved. It became a perfect view of the void. Terrapin Station was gone.

"Welcome to the first walk, Milo," Echo said. "The Captain is pleased you joined him."
