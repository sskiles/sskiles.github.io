That one slow nod in the observatory was the start of our conversation, a conversation we had almost entirely without words. I went back to that silent room for three days straight. By the fourth day, I'd learned to be quiet, too. On the fifth, he invited me on a "walk." My heart started hammering. This was it. "Yes," I said, my voice sounding weird and loud in the quiet. "I'll go." A tiny, almost invisible smile touched his lips. He nodded again and pushed off toward the door, leaving me to follow him.

Wilkins was waiting for us in the hallway. As Roberts floated by, a small, white sphere detached from a charging port on the wall and fell in line next to him, hovering silently. It was perfectly smooth, with no markings. I'd seen maintenance drones like it around the station, but this one followed Roberts with a strange, personal focus.

"Well, I'll be damned," Wilkins said, looking from Roberts's back to my face. "He's taking you on one of his 'walks'." He shook his head, a look of grudging respect on his face. "You've got guts, writer. Or you're a damn fool. Haven't figured out which yet."

As we followed Roberts through the decaying corridors, he glanced at a flickering light. The white sphere next to him pulsed with a soft light for a second. Wilkins, on my other side, grunted and pulled out a beat-up datapad. He glanced at the screen.

"He's right," Wilkins muttered, mostly to himself. "That whole conduit is about to go. I'll add it to the list." He saw me staring and gave me a wry grin. "Don't mind Echo. It's his... notepad. Saves him from having to type."

As we followed Roberts, my datapad chimed. It was the station's AI. *'Good morning, Milo. My sensors show your heart rate and breathing are up. Based on your job as a writer, I've made a list of meditation techniques popular with creative types. Want to see them?'*

"No, thanks," I muttered, shutting the device up.

Wilkins chuckled. "Helpful, right? The Wires are always trying to 'optimize' us." He shook his head. "Let's just say some of us would rather stay un-optimized."

I looked from the sphere—Echo—to Roberts, and then to Wilkins's datapad. A silent conversation. A man, a machine, and a mechanic, all talking without a sound. The efficiency of it was kind of intimidating. "So, where does he go on these walks?" I whispered.

"Out," Wilkins said, waving a hand vaguely toward space. "Just... out. Vanishes for days, sometimes weeks. Comes back with nothing but new sensor readings and that same look in his eyes. Some people think he's a claim jumper. Others think he's just crazy. But I've seen his ship. It's not like anything I've ever worked on."

We got to a small, abandoned cargo bay at the far end of the station. There, held by magnetic clamps, was the ship. The *Lacuna*. Its seamless, matte-black hull seemed to swallow the light. It looked less like a machine and more like a solid piece of the void.

Roberts floated to a spot on the hull and put his palm on it. A circle of the black material just dissolved, creating a perfect, round opening. It was as quiet and easy as a thought. Roberts, with Echo right behind him, floated inside. He turned, looked at me, and waved me in.

"Go on, then," Wilkins murmured behind me. "Your story's waiting."

I took a deep breath and pushed off, leaving the sanity of Terrapin Station behind and floating through the impossible door. The inside was a single, egg-shaped room of soft, white light. Roberts floated to the center and sat in a meditative pose, with Echo hovering silently by his shoulder. The doorway sealed behind me, and I was in a self-contained world of total quiet.

I drifted, not sure what to do. I expected it to be minimal, but this was just... absence. How did he even fly this thing? My mind was racing, but I kept my mouth shut.

"He doesn't mind questions, you know. He just doesn't like to answer them himself."

The voice was clear, calm, and way too close. I spun around. Roberts hadn't moved.

"Down here," the voice said, with a hint of fun in it.

My eyes locked on the white sphere. Echo. A tiny, dark blue lens had appeared on its surface, like a pupil opening. It was looking at me.

"You can talk?" I stammered. My whole understanding of the situation just fell apart.

"Of course," Echo said, its voice surprisingly warm. "The Captain finds silence to be a clearer language. But it can be a bit lonely for guests. On the ship, I do the talking."

I stared from the talking sphere to the silent man. The notepad. Wilkins had really undersold it. "You're... his translator?"

"Not exactly," Echo said. A nearly invisible seam opened on its surface, and a tiny, jointed arm came out, holding a microscopic sensor. It zipped over to my sleeve, gently picked off a single speck of dust from the station, and pulled back in. "I'm more of a reflection. He's the quiet observer; I'm the curious voice. We're two sides of the same thought."

Roberts stayed perfectly still, a silent confirmation of what Echo said.

"For example," Echo went on, bobbing toward the front of the room, "he's decided it's time to go. Shall we see what's over the horizon?"

Before I could answer, I felt a weird lurching feeling. Not like we were speeding up, but like we'd been moved. As if the ship hadn't moved, but space had just shifted around us. I stumbled and caught myself on a wall that felt as smooth and warm as a polished stone.

"Sorry about that," Echo said. "The first jump can be a little weird. The Captain thinks you'll find the view pretty amazing."

"The view?" I asked, looking around the windowless room. "How?"

"Like this," Echo said.

And the entire front wall of the ship dissolved into a perfect, unfiltered view of space. Terrapin Station was gone. We were adrift in the deep, a tiny island of light and life in a huge, silent, beautiful ocean of emptiness.

"Welcome to the first walk, Milo," Echo said softly, floating next to me. "The Captain is glad you decided to come along."
