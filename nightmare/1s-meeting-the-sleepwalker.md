The shuttle from Phobos was a tin can, plain and simple. It was a relic from the early days of Martian colonization when "comfort" wasn't in the budget. For a guy like me, a writer who'd lived his whole life in the perfectly controlled air of a domed colony, the trip was hell. But I was chasing a ghost. A whisper in the data streams about a man named Roberts, a so-called "sleepwalker." The idea of him had become an obsession. This story was my ticket out of writing corporate fluff. It was about real independence, something so foreign to my life on Mars it might as well have been a fairy tale.

I was headed to Terrapin Station, a forgotten speck in orbit that people whispered about as the last stop for those wanting to vanish. The ride there was an exercise in just letting go. The whole ship rattled and groaned, and the silence between burns was a constant, terrifying reminder of how little was between me and the void. It was like shedding all the fake safety of the colony and getting a dose of raw space. It was terrifying, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't also a little thrilling. I held my datapad, its screen dark. I knew this wasn't a story I could research. I had to live it.

The station airlock hissed open with a tired sigh, revealing a world lit by the dim, red glow of emergency lights. I pushed off and floated into the main corridor, feeling completely disoriented. The place was silent and falling apart. The air was thin and tasted like ozone and old metal. The only sound was the low hum of life support, a huge change from the noise of the Martian cities. This place was forgotten, left to rot in orbit. You could see it everywhere: patched walls, exposed wires—decades of quick fixes.

I felt like a clumsy intruder from another planet. I was used to the colony's artificial gravity, so my movements were all wrong. I bumped into a pipe, making the lights flicker. The few people I saw looked pale and thin, with a far-off look in their eyes, like they stared at the stars more than each other. They moved with a slow, deliberate grace, saving every bit of energy. Their silence was a wall, and they looked at me with suspicion.

"You lost, or just looking around?" The voice was so loud in the quiet it made me jump. A man floated out from a side passage, moving like he was born in zero-g. He was wiry, with a sharp, weathered face and eyes that didn't miss a thing. His jumpsuit was patched and covered in pockets, and his tool belt was loaded with gadgets.

"A little of both," I said, grabbing a handhold to steady myself. "I'm Milo."

"Wilkins," he said with a quick nod. "I'm the welcome wagon, general store, and mechanic for this rust bucket. If you need parts, info, or a half-decent cup of recycled coffee, I'm your guy. Info costs extra." He looked me over, his eyes pausing on my clean colony clothes. "You don't look like you're here to retire. You're either running from something or looking for something. Since you came here, I'll bet you're looking."

"I'm a writer," I said. "I'm looking for a man named Roberts."

Wilkins' face didn't change, but I saw a flicker of amusement in his eyes. "A writer. Huh. We don't get many of your type out here. Too quiet. As for Roberts... you're not the first to ask. He's a local legend. The man who really unplugged. Not just from the data streams, but from the Wires themselves." He tapped a nearby pipe. "He thinks they're always listening." Wilkins leaned in close. "And they are. So we try not to say anything interesting." He looked me over again. "Why him?"

"I want to understand his story," I said. "Why he chose this life."

"Chose it?" Wilkins laughed, a dry, crackling sound. "That's a nice way of saying it. Most of us are here because we have nowhere else to go. Roberts is different. He came here for a reason. He wasn't running from the worlds, he was running *to* the quiet." He motioned for me to follow. "Alright, writer. I'll take you to him. Don't expect a conversation. He doesn't talk. To anyone. But I'll get you in the room. The rest is on you."

I followed Wilkins through a maze of corridors, going deeper into the station's decaying, lonely heart. He knew his way around, pointing out things I never would have noticed. "Old man Hemlock tried to grow potatoes there," he said, pointing at a dark corner with some dead vines. "And that," he said, tapping a sealed door, "is the 'medbay.' Hasn't been opened in twenty years. We're all our own doctors here."

His stories painted a picture of life on the station. It was a community of forgotten people, clinging to life at the edge of everything. They were the solar system's castaways, the ones who'd slipped through the cracks. They weren't just surviving; they'd built their own little society, with its own rules and its own legends. And Roberts was their biggest one.

"We're here," Wilkins said, stopping at a heavy door marked 'OBSERVATORY.' "He likes the view." He gave me one last look. "Don't get your hopes up. The man's more star than human now." He didn't knock, just pushed the door open into pure darkness. He gave me a little nudge, and I floated in. The door hissed shut, and I was alone in the silence.

The only light was the stars. The view was insane, a wall of glittering infinity that just sucked the thoughts right out of my head. It was a temple to emptiness. And floating in the middle of it all was a figure. It was Roberts, a silhouette against the Milky Way, perfectly still. He wore a stripped-down, skeletal environment suit. He was so still, he seemed less like a person and more like a part of space itself.

I drifted into the room, my heart pounding. I didn't say anything. Words, my whole life, felt useless here. They were just noise, and this place was all about quiet. For a long time, we just floated there in the dark, two tiny specks of life in a huge, empty space—the writer and his myth. I could feel the frantic energy of my world—the deadlines, the ambition, the noise—just melting away.

Then, so slowly it felt like forever, Roberts turned his head. His eyes were adjusted to the dark, and they looked like pools of night reflecting the stars. He wasn't surprised or scared. He just looked at me with a calm recognition, like he'd been expecting me. He gave me a slow, tiny nod. A silent hello from one lonely soul to another. And in that single gesture, I felt it. The beginning of my story. A connection, for just a second, in the sleepwalker's silent dream.
