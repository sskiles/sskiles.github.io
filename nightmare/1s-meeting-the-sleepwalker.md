The shuttle from Phobos was an old ship, built for function, not comfort. I was a writer from the Martian colonies, and this journey was my starting point. I was chasing a ghost named Roberts, a "sleepwalker." The story was an obsession, a way to escape the corporate narratives I usually wrote. It was a story about independence, an idea that was now just a myth in Martian society.

I was headed to Terrapin Station, a place for people who wanted to disappear. The journey was a lesson in letting go. The ship's groans were a constant reminder of the void outside. It stripped away the colony's false safety. It was a terrifying immersion into the reality of space. I clutched my datapad, but I knew this story required experience, not research.

The station's airlock opened to a dim corridor lit by emergency lights. I floated inside, finding a world of quiet disorder. The air was thin and metallic. The hum of life support was the only sound, unlike the noisy Martian cities. The station was forgotten, left to crumble. Patched walls and exposed wires showed its age.

I felt like a clumsy intruder. My zero-g movements were awkward. I bumped into a conduit and the lights flickered. The few people I saw looked tired. They moved with a slow grace, their glances suspicious.

"Lost, or just sightseeing?" The voice was loud in the quiet. A man floated into the corridor. He was stout, with a weathered face and sharp eyes. He wore a jumpsuit and a tool belt full of gadgets.

"A bit of both," I said, steadying myself. "I'm Milo."

"Wilkins," he nodded. "I'm the welcome wagon, general store, and mechanic. Information costs extra." He looked at my clean clothes. "You're not here to retire. You're either running from something or looking for it. I'm betting you're looking."

"I'm a writer," I said. "I'm looking for Roberts."

Wilkins seemed amused. "A writer. We don't get many of your kind here. Too quiet. You're not the first to ask about Roberts. He's a local legend. The man who unplugged from the data streams, from the Wires themselves." He tapped a conduit. "He thinks they're always listening." He leaned in. "They are. So we don't give them anything to hear." He looked at me. "Why him?"

"I want to understand his story," I said. "Why he chose this."

"Chose it?" Wilkins chuckled. "Most of us just end up here. Roberts is different. He came with a purpose. He was running *to* the silence, not from the worlds." He gestured for me to follow. "Alright, writer. I'll take you to him. He won't talk. But I'll get you in the room. The rest is on you."

I followed Wilkins through winding passages. He pointed out invisible landmarks. "Old man Hemlock tried to grow potatoes there," he said, pointing to dead vines. He tapped a sealed hatch. "The medbay. Hasn't been opened in twenty years. We're our own doctors here." His tour painted a picture of a forgotten community. They were castaways who had built their own society. Roberts was their myth.

"We're here," Wilkins said at a door labeled 'OBSERVATORY.' "He likes the view." He gave me a final look. "Don't expect much. He's more star than human now." He pushed the door open to a dark room, pushed me inside, and the door shut. I was left in silence.

The only light came from the stars. The view was a wall of silent, glittering infinity. A figure floated in the center. It was Roberts, silhouetted against the void, perfectly still. He wore a stripped-down environment suit. He seemed less a man and more a part of space itself.

I drifted into the room. My heart pounded. I didn't speak. Words were useless here. We floated in the quiet darkness, the writer and his myth. The noise of my old life dissolved.

Slowly, Roberts turned his head. His eyes reflected the starlight. He wasn't surprised, just calm. He gave a slow nod, a silent greeting. In that gesture, my story began.
