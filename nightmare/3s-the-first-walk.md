"This is a simple delivery," Echo said. "We're taking equipment to a place called 'The Tangle'."

A delivery felt mundane. I had expected something more profound.

"The task is mundane," Echo corrected. "The journey is the purpose."

The ship's wall showed us Terrapin Station. A plasma engine core floated out of a cargo bay. "The Tangle is a habitat of scavengers," Echo explained. "They don't trust the corporate shipping lanes. When they need something moved quietly, they call a sleepwalker."

The engine was too big for the ship. But as it got closer, the *Wanderer's* hull flowed and reshaped itself. It formed a cradle that held the cargo. The process was silent and impossible.

"The *Wanderer* is accommodating," Echo said.

The ship sealed and we jumped. Space warped around us. "Why do they need the engine?" I asked.

"The Tangle is falling apart," Echo said. "The engine will stabilize their orbit."

The journey was long and quiet. Roberts meditated. We were completely alone. This was the sleepwalker's world, a hidden network of trust outside the system.

We arrived. The Tangle was a chaotic web of ships and asteroids lashed together. It was a wounded beast in the dark.

"They are watching," Echo said. "They will not hail us."

We approached a docking bay in a hollowed-out asteroid. We released the engine core. Tractor beams pulled it inside. The job was done. No words were exchanged.

Our payment was a single, encrypted data packet. A red light pulsed on Echo's surface.

"Unusual," the sphere said. "The encryption is old Earth Fleet military-grade. It's flagged as a warning."

We pulled away. The Tangle was a monument to independence. And it had paid us with a ghost.
