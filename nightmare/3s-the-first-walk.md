"The first walk is a simple delivery," Echo's voice filled the quiet, white room of the *Lacuna*. "The Captain's been hired to move a piece of gear from Terrapin Station to a... less stable place called 'The Tangle'."

"A delivery?" I asked, surprised. I thought our first trip would be to some quiet, remote corner of space. This sounded boring.

"The job is boring," Echo corrected gently. "The trip is the point. The cargo is just an excuse."

Right on cue, the front wall of the ship dissolved into a perfect view of space. But instead of stars, we were looking at the chaotic, spinning mess of Terrapin Station. A part of the station's hull peeled back, showing a cargo bay. Inside, held by magnetic clamps, was a big, cylinder-shaped thing: a plasma engine core.

"The Tangle is a group of scavengers and engineers," Echo explained as a series of magnetic pulses gently pushed the engine core out of the bay and toward us. "They don't trust the corporate shipping companies or the official channels. Too much chatter. Too many questions. When they need something moved quietly, they call a sleepwalker."

The engine core floated toward our open hatch. It was a huge, complicated piece of machinery, and I realized with a shock that it wouldn't fit inside the *Lacuna*. But as it got closer, the hull of our ship seemed to... unravel. The matte-black material flowed and reshaped itself, forming a secure cradle on the outside that wrapped around the engine. The whole thing was silent, organic, and totally impossible.

"The Captain likes to travel light," Echo said. "But the *Lacuna* can be accommodating."

With the cargo safe, the ship sealed itself up. The view of Terrapin Station vanished, replaced by the familiar, weird rush of warped spacetime. We were moving.

"Why do they need a new engine?" I asked, my eyes glued to the swirling cosmos.

"The Tangle is falling apart," Echo said. "Literally. They need the engine to stabilize their orbit. Without it, their home will be torn apart by tidal forces in a few months."

The trip was long and quiet. Roberts stayed in his meditative state, a calm center in our strange, speeding world. I watched the universe bend around us. The silence was only broken by Echo's occasional, poetic comments about gravity, or the beauty of a faraway nebula.

We were completely alone. No other ships passed us. No signals, no chatter, no noise. This was the sleepwalker's world. A hidden network of trust and favors that existed completely outside the loud, messy world of the colonies. They were the quiet delivery guys for a society that had learned not to trust the official ways of doing things.

After what felt like days, we arrived. The Tangle was a stunning, terrifying sight. It was a chaotic web of interconnected ship hulls, asteroids, and salvaged station parts, all tied together in what looked like a random mess. It spun slowly, like a wounded animal in the dark.

"They're watching," Echo said. "They see us, but they won't signal us. It's a trust thing."

Roberts guided the *Lacuna* toward the heart of the chaotic structure. As we got closer, a part of a huge, hollowed-out asteroid opened up, showing a docking bay. We released the engine core, and it was gently pulled inside by tractor beams.

Our job was done. No words were spoken. No docking fees were paid. A single, heavily encrypted data packet was sent to our ship. Payment. But as it arrived, a faint red light pulsed once on Echo's surface.

"That's weird," the sphere said, its voice losing its poetic tone for the first time. "The encryption is military-grade. Old Earth Fleet. And it's flagged as... a warning."

As we pulled away, I looked back at the strange, beautiful, chaotic mess of The Tangle. It was a monument to independence, to a group of people so set on escaping the noise of the universe that they had built their own world out of its junk. And they had just paid us with a ghost.
