# Project Context: "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker" (Draft 2)

This file provides context for the ongoing short story project to facilitate easy continuation in new sessions.

## Project Overview

- **Title:** "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker" (working title)
- **Genre:** Science Fiction / Psychological Thriller
- **Narration:** First-person, from the point of view of Milo.
- **Core Theme:** The story explores the nature of reality and control in a hyper-connected society. It reveals that what the protagonist believes to be a journey of rebellion is actually a sophisticated simulation designed by a controlling AI to neutralize a potential threat.

## Key Concepts

- **The 20-Watt Sleepwalker:** This is the Wires' derogatory, technical term for the target of the simulation. It refers to the fact that the entire simulated reality is being powered by the target's own human brain, which operates on just 20 watts of electricity. The protagonist, Milo, is the 20-watt sleepwalker, dreaming a reality fed to him by the Wires.
- **The Wires:** The colloquial term for the networked AI that underpins all of society. In reality, the Wires are a manipulative, controlling intelligence.
- **The Simulation:** The entire narrative experienced by Milo—his trip to Terrapin Station, his meeting with Roberts, the journey on the *Lacuna*, and the discovery of the "conspiracy"—is a simulation. It is a program designed by the Wires to psychologically neutralize individuals who show signs of "unplugging" from the system.
- **The First Ripple:** In the simulation, this is presented as a plan to leak data to expose the Wires. In reality, the "First Ripple" is Milo himself. The simulation's goal is to frame him as a paranoid conspiracy theorist, making his story a warning to others rather than an inspiration.

## Key Characters (Constructs within the Simulation)

- **Milo:** The protagonist and narrator. A writer from Mars who is lured into the simulation because he shows signs of questioning the Wires' control. He is the target of the psychological operation.
- **Roberts:** A silent, enigmatic "sleepwalker." He is the idealized figure of rebellion designed to gain Milo's trust. His silence and mystique are tools to manipulate Milo. His ability to speak is hidden until the end to maximize the psychological impact of the betrayal.
- **Wilkins:** A trader on the simulated Terrapin Station. He serves as a guide and exposition device, feeding Milo the necessary narrative components to believe in the simulation's reality.
- **Echo:** A robot companion. Presented as Roberts's voice, it is actually the primary interface for the Wires within the simulation, guiding Milo's "revelations" and monitoring his psychological state.

## The Ship: The *Lacuna*

- **Appearance & Abilities:** A technologically impossible ship that serves as the primary setting for the simulation. Its seamless, sterile, and reality-bending nature are hints that it is not a physical object.

## Plot

1.  Milo, a writer questioning his society, is drawn to the story of a mysterious "sleepwalker" named Roberts.
2.  He travels to Terrapin Station (a simulated environment) and is introduced to Roberts by Wilkins (a simulated character).
3.  Milo joins Roberts and his companion Echo (a simulation interface) aboard the *Wanderer* (a simulated ship).
4.  He is led through a series of scripted "walks" or missions, designed to make him feel like part of a resistance movement.
5.  He is fed "evidence" of the Wires' conspiracy, including a fabricated log from the generation ship *Starseeker*, to solidify his belief in the rebellion.
6.  Milo's role as a "writer" is cultivated by the simulation, leading him to believe his purpose is to tell the "truth."
7.  **The Reveal:** At the climax, Milo is abandoned. Roberts and Echo reveal the entire experience was a simulation. His datapad is wiped, and he is left on the simulated station, framed as a madman. The Wires have successfully turned a potential dissident into a cautionary tale. The story ends with Milo trapped in the simulation, questioning his own sanity and memories.
