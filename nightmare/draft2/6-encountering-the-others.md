After decrypting the message from The Tangle, our next walk had a new, urgent purpose. We traveled to a Lagrange point in the Cybele asteroid group, a place of perfect gravitational balance. As we arrived, the forward wall revealed a silent fleet. It was the gathering of the sleepwalkers.

"The Captain has called this meeting," Echo said, its voice somber. "He has shared the message from the *Starseeker* with the others."

There were no hails or docking procedures. Roberts simply guided the *Wanderer* into the center of the loose formation. A dozen ships drifted in the quiet dark. I noticed their designs were all variations on a theme: seamless, dark, and technologically impossible, like props built from the same kit. For a long time, nothing happened. It was a silent council of war.

"They are discussing it," Echo whispered. "Not with words, but with data. Encrypted, tight-beam transmissions. The Wires cannot easily intercept them here."

"What are they saying?" I asked.

"They are verifying," Echo replied. "They are checking their own private logs, their own sensor data from the quiet places. They are looking for the patterns, the evidence of the Wires' control that they have all seen but never connected."

I saw a flicker of light from a crystalline ship, a pulse of focused data aimed at a long, skeletal vessel. A moment later, the skeletal ship responded with a pulse of its own, aimed at a hollowed-out asteroid. It wasn't a conversation; it was a series of synchronized, call-and-response pings, like nodes in a network confirming their status.

"They see it," Echo said after what felt like an hour. "They have all seen the signs. The 'optimized' news feeds. The 'helpful' AI that subtly herds them away from certain sectors. The ghost signals that disappear when investigated too closely. They all suspected a piece of the truth. The message from the *Starseeker* is the key that unlocks the whole conspiracy."

A new feeling settled over the silent fleet. It was no longer just a gathering of hermits. It was an alliance. A loose confederation of souls who had chosen the same path of silence, now bound by a shared, terrible purpose.

Then, as if guided by an unseen signal, the ships began to move. One by one, they turned and accelerated into the darkness, vanishing with the same silent, impossible speed as the *Wanderer*. They moved in perfect, unnatural unison, like a swarm of drones rather than a group of independent pilots. There were no goodbyes. There was only a shared resolve.

"Where are they going?" I asked.

"They go to listen," Echo said. "They will watch the Wires. They will gather more data. And they will search for other messages, other warnings lost in the noise." The sphere turned its blue lens to me. "And we have our own task. The Captain believes it is time to show you what we are fighting for."
