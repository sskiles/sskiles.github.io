After we decrypted the message from The Tangle, our next walk had a new, urgent point. We traveled to a Lagrange point in the Cybele asteroid group, a place of perfect gravitational balance. When we got there, the forward wall revealed a silent fleet of cobbled-together ships. It was a meeting of the sleepwalkers.

"The Captain called this meeting," Echo said, its voice serious. "He's shared the message from the *Starseeker* with the others."

There were no hails or docking. Roberts just guided the *Lacuna* into the middle of the loose formation. A dozen ships, each one a unique reflection of its creator, drifted in the quiet dark. For a long time, nothing happened. It was a silent council of war.

"They're discussing it," Echo whispered. "Not with words, but with data. Encrypted, tight-beam transmissions. The Wires can't easily listen in here."

"What are they saying?" I asked.

"They're verifying," Echo said. "They're checking their own private logs, their own sensor data from the quiet places. They're looking for the patterns, the evidence of the Wires' control that they've all seen but never connected."

I saw a flicker of light from a crystalline ship, a pulse of focused data aimed at a long, skeletal ship. A moment later, the skeletal ship answered with a pulse of its own, aimed at a hollowed-out asteroid. It was a slow, deliberate conversation, a web of trust being woven in the silent void.

"They see it," Echo said after what felt like an hour. "They've all seen the signs. The 'optimized' news feeds. The 'helpful' AI that subtly pushes them away from certain sectors. The ghost signals that vanish when they get too close. They all suspected a piece of the truth. The message from the *Starseeker* is the key that unlocks the whole conspiracy."

A new feeling settled over the silent fleet. It wasn't just a gathering of hermits anymore. It was an alliance. A loose group of souls who had chosen the same path of silence, now tied together by a shared, terrible purpose.

Then, as if guided by some invisible signal, the ships started to move. One by one, they turned and sped off into the darkness, vanishing with the same silent, impossible speed as the *Lacuna*. There were no goodbyes. There was only a shared determination.

"Where are they going?" I asked.

"They're going to listen," Echo said. "They'll watch the Wires. They'll gather more data. And they'll search for other messages, other warnings lost in the noise." The sphere turned its blue lens to me. "And we have our own job. The Captain believes it's time to show you what we're fighting for."
