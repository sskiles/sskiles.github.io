After decrypting the message, we had a new purpose. We traveled to a quiet spot in the asteroid belt. A silent fleet of strange ships was waiting. It was a meeting of the sleepwalkers.

"The Captain called this meeting," Echo said. "He shared the *Starseeker* message."

We floated into the center of the formation. There were no hails. For a long time, nothing happened. It was a silent council of war.

"They are discussing it," Echo whispered. "With encrypted data. The Wires can't easily intercept it here."

"What are they saying?" I asked.

"They are verifying," Echo replied. "They are checking their own logs for the patterns of the Wires' control."

I saw pulses of light jump between the ships. It was a slow, deliberate conversation.

"They see it," Echo said after an hour. "They have all seen the signs. The 'optimized' news. The 'helpful' AI. The ghost signals. The *Starseeker* message is the key that unlocks the conspiracy."

The feeling changed. It was no longer a gathering of hermits. It was an alliance.

Then, the ships began to move. One by one, they turned and vanished into the darkness. There were no goodbyes, only a shared purpose.

"Where are they going?" I asked.

"To listen," Echo said. "To watch the Wires and gather more data." The sphere turned to me. "And we have our own task. It is time to show you what we are fighting for."

The *Wanderer* turned and jumped. We were heading back toward the inner system, back to the noise.

"We are going to show you the heart of the machine," Echo said. "We are going to show you the Wires."

I looked at Roberts. He was no longer just a man. He was a general of a silent army. And I was his chronicler. My datapad felt heavy with the weight of a story that could change everything.
