**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 16. Approaching Terrapin Station.**

Jumps are done. Stomach's adjusted, but the nausea is gone and something worse has taken its place. Dread. A cold knot of it.
There it is on the screen. Terrapin Station.
Not a homecoming. Feels like returning to the scene of a crime.

The airlock cycles again. That familiar, thin air hits me. The tang of ozone and the ghost of stale ale I remember, but it's worse now. My feet touch grimy deck plating. The false gravity pulls heavy.

I'm not the same man who first drifted through its airlock. That corporate drone, a ghost from another life. Now I'm a different ghost. A marked man. An accomplice.

The thought is a broken record, heavier with each jump.
Too easy. All of it. Too easy.
Finding Roberts? Too easy.
The strange ship, the Convocation, the neat package of data sent into the void.
It feels written. A script. A well-designed trap I've been walking into since the beginning.
Since I first said the name. "Sleepwalker."
A trap.

Paranoia is a survival trait. Or is it? Can't shake the feeling. Something is wrong.

Roberts turns. Display shows a comms scrambler. Then a picture of Wilkins. Clear message.
"Acquire the package from Wilkins," the sphere says.
A simple errand.
Too simple. The perfect setup for an ambush.

Pushing off towards the airlock. My notebook feels heavy. Not a weapon. An indictment.
"I'll be quick." The words sound hollow, a stranger's voice.
Walking back into the station. Into the trap.
I feel it closing around me. Jaws of it.
But there's nowhere else to go.
