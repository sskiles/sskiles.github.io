**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 16. Approaching Terrapin Station.**

Jumps again. Less nauseating this time. My stomach has mostly adjusted.

The *Lacuna* shimmers. Terrapin Station hangs before us. A decaying silhouette. A homecoming to a house that isn't yours anymore. I'm not the same person who left.

A real story. But it feels... too easy. Finding Roberts. The ship. The neat package of data sent into the void. A flicker of a thought. A cold whisper. *A well-designed trap.* I shake it off. Paranoia. Just the Wires trying to get in my head. The *Lacuna*'s convulsive travels.

Roberts turns. His eyes hold mine. Echo speaks, its voice flat.

"Wilkins has the scramblers. Essential for the Ganymede drop. You need to acquire them."

A simple errand. A final check before the ripple spreads.

I push off towards the airlock. My notebook clutched tight. My weapon. My truth.

"I'll be quick." The words sound hollow, a stranger's voice.
