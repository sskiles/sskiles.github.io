**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 16. Approaching Terrapin Station.**

More jumps again. Less nauseating. My stomach has mostly adjusted.

The *Lacuna* shimmers. Terrapin Station hangs before us. A decaying silhouette. A homecoming to a house that isn't yours anymore. I'm not the same person who left.

A real story. A chance to make a difference, be known. It feels... too easy. Finding Roberts. The ship. The neat package of data recovered from the void. A flicker of a thought. A cold feeling. Something's not right. I shake it off. Paranoia. Just the Wires trying to get in my head. The *Lacuna*'s convulsive travels.

Roberts turns. His eyes hold mine. Echo speaks, its flat voice.

"Wilkins has the scramblers. Essential for the Ganymede relays. You need to get them."

A final step before we start the ripple.

I push off towards the airlock. My hand cold.  My notebook clutched tight. The words that will shine a light on the Wires. The truth. My truth.

"I'll be quick." My voice betraying my confidence.
