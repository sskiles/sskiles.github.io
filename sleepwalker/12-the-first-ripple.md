**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 15. Aboard the Lacuna.**

The Convocation was a dizzying blur. I'm an accomplice to... something. A conspiracy of ghosts.
My notebook doesn't feel like a weapon. It feels like evidence. A detailed log of every crime I've witnessed and participated in since Phobos.

There was no discussion after the meeting, no vote. The decision was simply made.

Roberts puts the data from Vance's shard back on the main display. He begins to work, his hands moving through the light, isolating the most damning parts of Dr. Thorne's log.
Her voice cracking as she talks about the botany labs. The cold mention of "The Warden."
He's not preserving a story. He's sharpening a knife.

He looks at me. Gestures to the screen, then to my notebook.
I understand.
My job isn't to make it sing. It's to transcribe. To turn the fragmented audio into a clean, readable data file.

The work is cold and technical.
This isn't the catharsis of finding my voice.
It's the quiet terror of writing down something that could get me killed.
Each word I type feels like another bar on a cage I'm building for myself.

When I'm done, Roberts takes the file. He works silently, packaging the data, wrapping it in layers of encryption I can't begin to understand.
On the display, I see a destination address flash for a second before it's buried in code: a fringe news outlet on Ganymede.

He sends it.
The act is silent. Anticlimactic.

A stone has been tossed into the storm. There's no turning back now.
We just threw a rock at the titans. All we can do is wait and see if they noticed.
