title: The First Ripple

**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 15. Aboard the Lacuna.**

The Convocation was a dizzying blur. Faces on a screen, ships in the void, a shared, silent understanding. The Wires are real, pulling strings on a scale I can barely comprehend.

But Roberts and the others... they're fighting back in their own quiet way. And now, I'm part of it. My notebook, once a symbol of my own soulless assignments, now feels like a weapon.

The decision was made in that silent meeting. The First Ripple. We'll seed a fringe news outlet with bait: a fragment of the *Starseeker* log. A test. A stone tossed into the calm lake of the Wires' control to see what kind of monster surfaces.

My job is to make it real. To turn the raw data. The audio snippets... frantic text... optimization... pacification... into a story.

My pen scratches across the paper, translating the fragmented terror of Dr. Thorne into a narrative that has a beginning, a middle, and a soul-crushing end. This isn't corporate fluff. This is the truth, sharp and ugly. These words don't feel hollow. They feel heavy. Real.

Echo provides the tactical brief: a digital maze of redirection and encryption to evade the Wires' scrutiny. The target: a small, independent outlet on Ganymede known for its anti-corporate streak. The goal is to make the truth appear as if it materialized out of the ether.

I've never felt more alive. More purposeful. This is it. The First Ripple.
