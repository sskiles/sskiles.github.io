**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 8. Observatory.**

Five days.
Just... five days. Floating. In this quiet vacuum. With a ghost.
Silence. Not peaceful. A tactic. A test. Patience. Failing it.
Instinct says prod. Ask. Fill the void. My job. Is it? Not a story if no words.

Move. I have to. Risk.
Push him? Vanish. Trip a bust.
Don't? Just a tourist. Watching stars.

Can't just ask. Why so quiet? They would. Categorize. Quantify. Diagnose.
Corporate thinking. Show him I'm not one of them.

Voice. Too loud. Intrusion. "I'm not here to write a profile piece."

He doesn't move. Statue against fusion and dust.

"I'm here because you did what I thought was impossible. Walked away from the noise. From the feeds, the chatter... all of it. I just need to know if it's real."

Silence. Heavier. Blown it. Stupid. Asked a ghost for a map from a man who burned his.

Then. He rotates. Slow. Zero-g. Looks *at* me. Not through.
Assessment. Long moment.
Same slow nod. From day one. But this time. A hint of a smile. Barely. An answer.

Hand raises. Gestures. To the door. Unspoken. Clear. *Follow me*.

Alright.
See. Where it goes.
