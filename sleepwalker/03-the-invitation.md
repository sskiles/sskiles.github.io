**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 8. Observatory.**

Two days. For two days, we have floated in quiet emptiness. Just me and a ghost. The silence isn't peaceful. It's a tactic. A test of patience. And I'm failing it.

Instinct says prod him. Ask. Fill the void. My job. Isn't it? Not a story if there are no words.

Move. I have to. Risk it.
Push him? He'll vanish. The trip a bust.
Don't? I'm just a tourist. Watching stars.

I can't just ask why he's so quiet. That's what *they* would do. Categorize. Quantify. Diagnose. This is my chance to show him I'm not one of them.

My voice feels too loud. An intrusion. "I'm not here to write a profile piece."

He doesn't move. A statue against fusion and dust.

"I'm here because you did what I thought was impossible. You walked away from the noise. From the feeds, the chatter... all of it. I just need to know if it's real."

Silence. Heavier now. I've blown it. Stupid. Asked a ghost for a story... a story  of a man who left his behind.

Then, he rotates. Slow. Zero-g. Looks *at* me, not through me.
An assessment. A long moment.
The same slow nod from day one, but this time, with a hint of a smile. Barely. An answer.

A hand raises. A gesture to the door. Unspoken. Clear. *Follow me*.

Alright.
I'll see where it goes.
