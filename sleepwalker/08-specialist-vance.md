**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 6. The Habitat Docking Bay.**

A wiry man enters the cavernous docking bay. All sharp angles and coiled authority. He starts overseeing thee crew as they maneuver the engine from our hull.

Echo's quiet voice states a single fact: "This is Jinx."

I glance at Roberts. The corner of his mouth twitches. A smile? There it is again. A rare flicker of emotion.

Jinx sizes me up with a single glance. Appraises, then dismisses. He turns to Roberts, his voice rough. "Good thing I heard you had the replacement." His eyes are already past Roberts, on the engine.

The reply isn't from Roberts. It's Echo. "Payment confirmed, Vance."

Jinx's eyes narrow, shifting to the floating orb. A sneer twists his lips. "That's *Specialist Vance* to you, you little ghost."

"Noted," Echo says, it's perfectly emotionless tone.

Vance turns back to Roberts, pulling a scarred data shard from his belt. "Got a bonus for you. Some weird transmission I snagged. Old encryption, but it pinged off a couple of markers I know you're interested in. A professional courtesy." He holds it out. An offering.

Roberts takes the shard. Gives Vance a slow, dismissive nod as he starts to turn.

Vance doesn't get the job is done. Or doesn't want to. He steps closer, "Got another run for you, Captain. Easy stuff. Quick credits."

A short, sharp snort from Roberts. He turns, gliding back toward the *Lacuna's* hatch without a word.

Vance's face flushes as he yells at Roberts's back. "Hey! It's a *good* run! Your loss, Captain!"

The hatch flows shut, sealing us back in the silent, white interior. The shard in Roberts's hand. 

The dismissive snort, Vance's frustrated face.
It clicks.
So that's why they call him Jinx.
