**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 9. The Habitat Docking Bay.**

Our walk ends in a cavernous, dimly-lit docking bay. A wiry man, all sharp angles and coiled authority, is already there, overseeing a small crew. As they maneuver the engine from our ship's exterior, the sphere's quiet voice states a single fact: "This is Jinx."

I look at Roberts. A slight smile touches the corner of his lips. The first flicker of emotion I've seen from him.

The man—Jinx—gives me a brief, appraising glance that sizes me up and dismisses me in the same beat. He turns his attention to Roberts. "Good thing I heard you had the replacement," he says, his voice rough, already looking past Roberts to the engine being moved.

The reply comes from the sphere. "Payment confirmed."

Jinx's eyes narrow, shifting to the floating sphere. A sneer twists his lips. "That's *Specialist Vance* to you, little ghost."

"Noted," the sphere says, its tone perfectly neutral.

Vance turns back to Roberts. "Got a bonus for you." He pulls a scarred data shard from his belt. "Some weird transmission I snagged. Old encryption, but it pinged a couple of markers I know you're interested in. Pure professional courtesy." He holds it out, waiting.

Roberts takes the shard. He gives Vance a final, slow nod. The gesture is dismissive.

Vance takes this as an invitation. He steps closer, eager. "Got another run for you, Captain. Easy stuff. Quick credits."

Roberts lets out a short, sharp snort of derision, turns, and glides toward the *Lacuna's* hatch without a backward glance.

"Hey!" Vance yells, frustrated, his face flushing. "It's a *good* run! Your loss, Captain!"

We retreat into the silent, white interior. The hatch flows shut, sealing us in with the quiet and the new data shard. I look from the shard in Roberts's hand to the closed hatch, replaying the scene. The name, the offer, the dismissive snort. It clicks. So that's why they call him Jinx.
