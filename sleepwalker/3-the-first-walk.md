The moment the view of the Hecuba Gap resolved on the forward wall, I felt a profound sense of agoraphobia. It was an emptiness so vast and complete it felt like a physical weight. I was a messy, organic anomaly in this surgically clean, minimalist world of white light and silent travel.

"It's beautiful, isn't it?" Echo's voice was soft, pulling me from my reverie. The small white sphere floated near my shoulder. "The Captain believes this is one of the quietest places in this sector. A place where you can almost hear the universe thinking."

I looked from the starfield to Roberts, who floated in his harness, eyes closed, a picture of perfect tranquility. "Is this what he does? Just... find quiet places?"

"He is a connoisseur of silence," Echo replied. "Most beings, when they look at a place like this, see nothing. He sees everything that isn't there. The absence of noise, of radiation, of interference. It is a canvas, and he is here to appreciate it."

The *Wanderer* moved with a purpose that felt less like navigation and more like a form of meditation. There was no sense of time. My own internal clock, so used to the rigid cycle of Mars, was hopelessly lost. I was untethered. I tried to write, but my words felt clumsy. How do you describe a color that has no name? How do you explain a sound that is the absence of all sound?

"The Captain suggests you stop trying to describe it," Echo said gently, as if sensing my frustration. "He suggests you simply feel it. Your vocabulary was built for a world of solid objects and loud noises. It is not equipped for this."

I put the datapad away. Roberts made a minute adjustment to our course with a simple, almost imperceptible gesture. A slight turn of his hand, and the starfield rippled.

"He is connected to this vessel on a level that transcends technology," Echo explained, its blue lens focused on Roberts. "He doesn't fly the *Wanderer*; he dances with it. He is navigating the unseen gravitational tides, seeking the point of perfect equilibrium."

After an immeasurable period, the ship slowed, the distorted starlight resolving back into sharp pinpricks. We had arrived at the heart of the Hecuba Gap, a celestial desert where the gravity of Jupiter had flung all but the most stubborn rocks into other orbits.

"We are here," Echo announced.

Roberts unstrapped himself and floated to the center of the chamber. He closed his eyes, and for a full hour, he simply hung there, perfectly still. He wasn't asleep; he was bathing in the silence, soaking in the profound peace of this empty place.

"This is the purpose of the walk," Echo whispered, its voice barely disturbing the quiet. "It is not about the destination, but the state of being it allows. A pilgrimage to the heart of nowhere, to find the last few places where one can truly be alone."
