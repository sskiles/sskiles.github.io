**Log Entry: Cycle 89, Sol 30. Deep Space (unregistered freighter).**

Days bleed into a featureless blur on the *Mercy's End*.
Every crew member's face looks like a potential corporate agent. Every flicker of a diagnostic light feels like a sign I've been found.
The paranoia is a constant, gnawing companion.

I sent the story. An anonymous upload, routed through a dozen dead drops. A whisper into the void.
Now, all I can do is wait and watch the public feeds.

Nearly two weeks later, I find it.
Buried in a fringe news aggregate from Ganymede, picked up by some corporate-syndicated "Arts & Culture" channel.
There it is: 'Dream of the 20-Watt Sleepwalker,' by 'Anonymous.' Accompanied by a stock image of a lonely space station.

They didn't censor it. They categorized it.
Harmless fiction.
The irony is a bitter taste in my mouth. Did I plant a seed, or did I just hand them a flower to press between the pages of a book, beautiful but dead?
I have no way of knowing.

The freighter makes its next drop at an automated waystation. I slip onto another anonymous ride. Another ghost on the run.

The story is out. My truth, wrapped in a lie, is being spread by the very system I was trying to expose.
But the victory, if it is one, feels hollow.
I have my notebook and the clothes on my back. I am still a man with no name, running to the next dark corner of the system.

Adrift.
