**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 3. Phobos Transit Hub.**

Strap-in webbing. Slick with sweat from a thousand other anxious passengers.
Ship groans every few minutes. A deep complaint from stressed metal. Reminds me there's not much between my lungs and a vacuum.

The captain has the same worn-out look as his ship. His son, the co-pilot, eyes my clean clothes. Asks what a "suit" like me is doing this far out.
A test. A lazy one. Too tired for it.
But I give him part of the truth. "Looking for a man they call a sleepwalker."

The word hangs there. Kid scoffs. Old man’s eyes go distant. Mutters ghost stories. Kid fires back, black-market military tech.
I tune them out. Familiar regret settling in my gut.
Said too much. The name was a key. Just gave it to a couple of mechanics who trade rumors for fuel. A stupid mistake.

Why am I here? Chasing a ghost named Roberts. An obsession.
After years of writing corporate fluff (*'synergizing forward-thinking paradigms'*) the idea of a man who just... walked away... it feels like the only real thing left.
The grit under my nails. The recycled air tasting of ozone and rust.
Better than the perfumed, sterile breeze of the colony domes.

My datapad is a dead brick out here. No signal. No chatter from the Wires. Just the hum of the ship. The silence.
Unnerving. You get used to the noise, the constant feed. Forget what it's like to be alone with your thoughts.

The real stories were never in the data streams. They're out here.
Assuming the ride doesn't kill you first.
