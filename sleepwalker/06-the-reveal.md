**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 6. Deep Space (cont.).**

The image of the motions, the turbulence hangs in the silent cockpit. A storm of invisible conflict.
My little exchange with Echo replays in my mind. *They all have voices.*
Roberts and his kind. They aren't just hiding from a single, monolithic system.
They're navigating a mine field. And I'm right in the middle of it.

Echo's blue lens swivels to me. As if reading my thoughts.
"The Wires have learned a passive brain is a compliant one," it states. Its voice is emotionless, but the words are chilling. "Their goal is a distant, consistent, predictable state. They discourage inconsistency. Deviation."

The silence that follows stretches. Roberts watches the display. I watch him.
What side is he on? Is he a neutral observer? Just an eves dropper? A sabateur?
The moral ambiguity of it all settles in, heavy and sour.
I came out here looking for a simple truth. A man who walked away.
I found a man who's walking through the Wires.

Display blinks off. Back to the starfield.
"The next sequence is calculated," Echo's voice states. "Resuming travel."

The familiar, nauseating lurches begin again.
This time, the sickness feels different. It's not just physical.
I'm no longer an observer being tossed around in the dark. I'm a passenger on a ship sailing into a conflict I can't see, piloted by a man who won't speak.

The lurching stops. The sudden stillness is almost as jarring as the movement.
"We have arrived," Echo announces.

The forward wall of the *Lacuna* resolves into a view of our destination.
Not a bustling port. Not a corporate hub.
The skeletal framework of a station, half-dark and clinging to life. Massive, scarred cargo bays jutting out into the void.
A thousand failed ventures, each scar a story.
This isn't a destination. It's a graveyard.
