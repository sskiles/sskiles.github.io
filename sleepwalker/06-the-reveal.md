**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 8. Deep Space (cont.).**

The image of the turbulence hangs in the silent cockpit. A storm of invisible conflict.
My little exchange with the sphere replays in my mind. *A practical application.*
Not just a turn of phrase.
Roberts and his kind. They aren't just hiding from a single, monolithic system.
They're navigating a warzone. And I'm right in the middle of it.

The silence stretches. Roberts watches the display. I watch him.
What side is he on? Is he a neutral observer? A combatant?
The moral ambiguity of it all settles in my gut, heavy and sour.
I came out here looking for a simple truth. A man who walked away.
I found a man who's walking through a minefield.

Display blinks off. Back to the starfield.
"The next sequence is calculated," the sphere's voice states. "Resuming travel."

The familiar, gut-wrenching lurches begin again.
This time, the sickness feels different. It's not just physical.
I'm no longer an observer being tossed around in the dark. I'm a passenger on a ship sailing into a war I can't see, piloted by a man who won't speak.

The lurching stops. The sudden stillness is almost as jarring as the movement.
"We have arrived," the sphere announces.

The forward wall of the *Lacuna* resolves into a view of our destination.
Not a bustling port. Not a corporate hub.
The skeletal framework of a station, half-dark and clinging to life. Massive, scarred cargo bays jutting out into the void.
A thousand failed ventures, each scar a story.
This isn't a destination. It's a graveyard.
