**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 3. Terrapin Station.**

The shuttle docks. A shudder that feels final.
Airlock cycles. Thin air, smelling of ozone and hot metal. The silence after the drone is heavy.
This station is a museum of makeshift repairs. Patched bulkheads, exposed conduits, flickering lights. A place where things come to break down for good.

My clean colony clothes feel like a costume. My movements too sharp, accustomed to a gravity that's a luxury now.
A mechanic in patched overalls corners me. Gives my clothes a look that could strip paint.
"Information costs extra out here," he grunts. The opening line of a negotiation.

"I'm looking for a man named Roberts," I say.

"'Roberts'?" Something like a smile cracks his weathered face. "Local legend, that one. A man who didn't just log off, but truly 'unplugged.'"
He thumps a shoddy conduit held with tape. "Talk too loud 'round here and the static starts to sound like your own voice, only smarter," he rasps. "Best to keep your thoughts behind your teeth."
Used to dismiss that talk as frontier paranoia. Out here, it's practical advice.
"I need to talk to him."

A dry chuckle, like grinding rust. He gives me a long look, sizing me up one last time. "Alright, writer. I'll take you." His eyes flick to my datapad. "But you're not bringing that. The man you're looking for doesn't like things that listen."

A toll. Fair enough. Swap the dead datapad for my coffee-stained notebook and pen. Only tool that still works, anyway.
He leads me to a heavy door marked 'OBSERVATORY'. Pushes it open into absolute blackness.

The door hisses shut behind me.
My own breathing, hot and loud in my ears.
And the realization hits, a sudden, sharp-edged certainty.
This was a mistake.

Then, my eyes adjust. The forward wall is gone. Replaced by an unfiltered, impossibly dense field of stars.
A figure silhouetted against it. Motionless in zero-g.
It has to be him.
He doesn't move. Looks less like a man, more like a part of the celestial mechanics.
He turns his head. Slow. Deliberate.
Not surprised. He's been waiting.
