**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 8. Deep Space.**

The forward wall dissolves. Terrapin Station hangs there. Then gone. Just ceases.

Lurch.
A gut-wrenching displacement. Nothing to do with acceleration. My stomach does a slow roll. Not a jump. Yanked sideways. Through reality. Another lurch. Different vector. Another. And another.
My voice unsteady. "What is this?"

Blue lens swivels. "This is how we travel." Flat. "Untraceable. The Wires cannot see."

Untraceable. Not hidden. Statistically impossible. Paranoid philosophy made real. My stomach heaves. Safety has a price.

The sphere's blue lens swivels back to me. "Your physiological signs are anomalous."

I manage a grunt.

"The Captain does not experience this phenomenon," it continues, its voice perfectly flat. "We have not had a guest in 3.4 standard years. This reaction was not predicted."

Another data point for the sphere.

Lurching stops. Sudden stillness. A relief. "Quiet corridor," the sphere announces. "To listen."

Nausea subsides. I look at the wall. Not star charts. Not.
A display. Web of chaotic, shifting energies. Silent. Swirling. Light. A galaxy of light.
Notebook out. Sketching. Trying to find the pattern. Anything. Imposing order. A silent aurora, I write, the ghost of a nebula bleeding through the code.
Whisper. "What is it?"

Blue lens swivels from notebook to display. "The Captain is listening." Flat. "To the turbulence."

"Turbulence?" My fanciful words. Looking at the screen. "Looks more like a storm."

"Apt," the sphere says. Devoid of praise. "But the Captain's work is not poetry. He is charting a course through the noise. A practical application."

The correction stings. I cross out my words. All of them. In the notebook.
These sleepwalkers. Not just hiding. Navigating something else. Something I never knew existed.
