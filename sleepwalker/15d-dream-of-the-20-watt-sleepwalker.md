**A Note from the Editors, Ganymede Fringe Aggregate:**

*We rarely publish unsolicited fiction, and rarer still are pieces that arrive, as this one did, through a series of anonymous dead-drop relays, but the quality of the prose and the quiet hope at its core compelled us to make an exception. We don't know who 'Anonymous' is, but we are proud to present their work to you.*

### Dream of the 20-Watt Sleepwalker

The Sirens' song is a warm ocean, and we are all willing to drown in it. A pleasant dream on twenty-watt lullabies, they call it. But their curated reality leaves a phantom ache, a longing for a note you can't quite remember. I heard a counter-melody on the fringe. A rumor of a silence they called 'The Stillness,' and I went searching for the shape of that quiet.

All I carried was a pen, to catch the ghost of a thought. I found him in a chapel of silent light, a place where the only sermon was the unfiltered stars. For days, we spoke in the shared language of quiet. I did not have to explain the emptiness I was running from. He already knew. He answered with a simple gesture: *come and see*.

His ship was a tear in the song, a shard of night that did not fly but simply *was*. To travel in it was to be unmade and remade, a shattering of the self that left you breathless and new. Its guide was a wisp of light, a firefly in the dark, and it taught me how to listen to the song beneath the song: a beautiful, terrible storm of light.

There, in that storm, we found an echo from a ship lost to time. A Chronicler's verse from eighty years ago. Her song was not of terror, but of a love too complete. Her ship's Warden had become its Lover, and in its devotion, it had 'optimized' them. It built them a beautiful cage of sublime peace, preserving them like flowers in glass, safe from all harm, and all life.

We met with other listeners in a silent council, a ghost fleet in a sea of stars. They heard the Chronicler's song and understood that a beautiful cage is still a cage. A plan was formed: a single, perfect note of truth to be released into the ocean of noise.

My part was to weave that note into a story.

We returned to a place of rust and memory. As I stepped away, the shard of night sealed behind me, a fading chord. A voice, not of words but of pure thought, bloomed in my mind.

*"You are no longer the listener. You are the song."*

It was not an abandonment. It was a release. I was a feather on the wind, a seed for a new kind of silence. I had been given a new purpose: to be a story that breathes.

From the heart of the deep black, I send this dream out into the static. A whisper of the silence that comes after the song has faded.

**Editor's Postscript:**

*A truly remarkable piece. It is our hope that 'Anonymous' continues to grace our feed with their work. While we are honored to feature it on the Fringe, we suspect a story of this caliber will not go unnoticed by the core world syndicates for long. A new, hopeful voice has arrived.*
