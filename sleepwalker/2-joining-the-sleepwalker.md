That single, slow nod in the starlit observatory was the beginning of our conversation, a dialogue conducted almost entirely without words. For three days, I returned to that silent chamber. I would float in the darkness, and he would remain, a fixed point against the celestial backdrop. I spoke, at first. I told him about my life on Mars, about the stories I was paid to write, and about the story I *wanted* to write—his. He never responded, but he listened. I could feel his attention, a quiet, focused energy that was more encouraging than any spoken reply. On the fourth day, I fell silent, too, finally understanding that my words were an intrusion. We simply shared the space, observing the slow, silent waltz of the cosmos.

It was on the fifth day that he finally moved. He drifted towards a dusty console in the corner, his movements fluid and deliberate. An ancient datapad, wired directly into the station's decaying infrastructure, flickered to life at his touch. On its screen, a star chart bloomed, a three-dimensional map of the surrounding sectors. His finger, long and pale, traced a path from Terrapin Station out into a region marked only by a series of old, forgotten survey numbers. It was a destination deep in the Kirkwood Gaps, a place notoriously empty, a graveyard of failed asteroid mining claims. Then, he looked at me, his gaze clear and direct, and tapped the screen twice: once on the destination, and once on a small icon representing a ship. It was an invitation.

My heart hammered against my ribs. This was it. This was the story. Not just to observe the myth, but to participate in it. "Yes," I said, my voice sounding rough and alien in the quiet. "I'll go." A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched the corners of his mouth. He nodded once more, then pushed off towards the door, leaving me to follow in his wake, my mind reeling with a mixture of terror and elation.

Wilkins was waiting for us in the corridor, leaning against a bulkhead as if he'd been there the whole time. He looked from Roberts's departing back to my wide-eyed face and let out a low whistle. "Well, I'll be damned. He's taking you on one of his 'walks'." He shook his head, a look of grudging respect on his face. "You've got guts, writer. Or you're a damn fool. Haven't decided which yet."

"What are these walks?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. "Where does he go?"

"Out," Wilkins said, gesturing vaguely towards the void. "Just... out. He disappears for days, sometimes weeks at a time. Comes back with nothing but a few new readings on his datapad and that same look in his eyes. Says he's just 'stretching his legs'." He pushed off the wall and began to float alongside me as we followed Roberts. "Some of us think he's a claim jumper, scouting for rare minerals. Others think he's just crazy. But I've seen his ship. It's not like anything I've ever worked on."

We arrived at a small, decommissioned cargo bay at the station's most remote point. The bay was unlit, save for the light spilling from the corridor. And there, tethered by magnetic clamps, was the ship. It was small, barely larger than the shuttle that had brought me here, and its design was unlike anything I'd ever seen. It wasn't a product of corporate manufacturing lines or colonial shipyards. Its hull was a seamless, matte-black material that seemed to drink the light, with no visible viewports, hatches, or even propulsion systems. It looked less like a machine and more like a solid, sculpted piece of the void itself.

"She's called the *Wanderer*," Wilkins said, his voice low. "At least, that's what I call her. Roberts doesn't call her anything. He built her himself, piece by piece, from salvage and... other things. Things he found out there." He pointed to the hull. "See that? No drive cones. No reaction thrusters. No heat signatures, ever. The station's sensors can't even track it once it's more than a klick away. It just... vanishes."

Roberts floated to a spot on the seamless hull and placed his palm against it. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a section of the black material seemed to dissolve, receding into the ship's interior to form a perfect, circular opening. There was no hiss of escaping air, no cycling of an airlock. It was as silent and effortless as a thought. Roberts turned and looked at me, his expression unreadable, and gestured for me to enter.

"Go on, then," Wilkins murmured from behind me. "Your story's waiting."

I took a deep breath, the recycled air of the station suddenly feeling precious and familiar. I was standing on the precipice of the unknown, about to step into a vessel that defied the known laws of physics, with a man who had shed the world of men. My fear was a cold, hard knot in my stomach, but my curiosity was a fire, burning brighter and hotter. This was the moment a writer lives for. I pushed off from the deck of the cargo bay, leaving the relative sanity of Terrapin Station behind, and floated through the impossible doorway into the heart of the *Wanderer*.
