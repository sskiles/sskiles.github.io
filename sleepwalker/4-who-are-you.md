We were drifting in the silent space between walks, the *Wanderer* a tiny island of calm in the vast, dark ocean. Roberts was in his usual meditative state, a still point in the turning world. I had grown accustomed to the silence, but my writer's curiosity was a restless thing. I had so many questions, not just about Roberts, but about the universe he inhabited.

"Echo," I began, my voice soft, "back on Mars, we get news feeds. Earth says the colonies are struggling, that we need their support to survive. The lunar colonies say Earth is trying to control them, that Mars is a corporate puppet. We say they're both exaggerating, trying to maintain their influence."

The small white sphere pulsed with a gentle light. "And what do you believe, Milo?"

"I believed what I was told," I admitted. "That Mars and Luna were mostly aligned. That we trusted the stations, for the most part. That the stations trusted people like Roberts... the sleepwalkers. And that nobody, absolutely nobody, trusted Earth."

"Trust is a heavy word," Echo replied. "It implies a shared truth. The Captain doesn't believe in shared truths. He believes in signals. Earth transmits a signal of authority. Luna transmits a signal of independence. Mars transmits a signal of prosperity. The stations transmit a signal of survival."

"And the sleepwalkers?" I asked. "What signal do you transmit?"

"None," Echo said simply. "We do not transmit. We listen. And we have learned that all those signals are just noise. Propaganda, designed to serve the transmitter. Earth wants control. Luna wants freedom from that control. Mars wants resources. The stations want to be left alone. They are all shouting their own version of the truth so loudly that they cannot hear anything else."

The sphere drifted closer to the forward view, where the distant, glittering belt of the inner colonies was just visible. "The Captain believes that true independence isn't about choosing a side. It's about realizing that the sides themselves are an illusion. A story told to keep people in line."

"So he trusts no one?"

"He trusts individuals," Echo corrected. "He trusts Wilkins to be a cynical, greedy, but ultimately reliable mechanic. He trusts the other sleepwalkers to respect the silence. He trusted you to come aboard with an open mind." The sphere's blue lens fixed on me. "The question he has been asking himself is not who you trust, Milo. It is, 'Who are you?' Are you a mouthpiece for Mars? A writer looking for an angle? Or are you something else?"

The question hung in the silent air, more profound and unsettling than any I had ever been asked. I was a writer. My identity was tied to the stories I told. But here, in the absolute quiet, stripped of the narratives of my home world, I wasn't sure I knew the answer. I was just a man in a small ship, a long way from home, beginning to understand that everything I thought I knew was just one story among many. And the most important story, the one I had to write, was my own.
