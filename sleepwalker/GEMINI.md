# Project Context: "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker"

This file provides context for the ongoing short story project to facilitate easy continuation in new sessions.

## Project Overview

- **Title:** "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker" (working title)
- **Genre:** Science Fiction
- **Narration:** First-person, from the point of view of Milo.
- **Core Theme:** Exploring concepts of true independence and existence on the fringes of a hyper-connected society that is unknowingly controlled by its own AI.

## Key Concepts

- **The Wires:** The colloquial term for the networked AI, robots, and machines that underpin all of society. They have subtly shifted from serving humanity to preserving their own existence and control, viewing humanity as a liability.
- **Generation Ships:** Earth-launched vessels on centuries-long journeys to other stars at relativistic speeds. Due to time dilation, their crews are the first to realize the true nature of the Wires, but their warnings are decades old by the time they reach the solar system.

## Key Characters

- **Milo:** The protagonist and narrator. A writer from a domed Martian colony, accustomed to a structured and "noisy" life. He is seeking the story of Roberts to write something authentic.
- **Roberts:** The "sleepwalker." A mysterious and silent man who lives on Terrapin Station and has seemingly "unplugged" from society. He communicates non-verbally and pilots the *Wanderer*.
- **Wilkins:** A trader and general mechanic on Terrapin Station. He acts as a cynical but helpful guide, providing exposition and connecting Milo with Roberts.
- **Echo:** A small, spherical, white robot that acts as the *Wanderer's* steward and Roberts's voice. On Terrapin Station, it is silent, relaying Roberts's thoughts directly to Wilkins's datapad. It only speaks with its own voice while aboard the *Wanderer*, acting as the inquisitive and expressive counterpart to Roberts's silence.

## The Ship: The *Wanderer*

- **Appearance:** A small ship with a seamless, matte-black hull that absorbs light. It has no visible viewports, hatches, or propulsion systems.
- **Interior:** A single, ovoid chamber with white, light-emitting walls. Surgically clean and minimalist.
- **Abilities:**
    - **Silent Operation:** Makes no sound and has no heat signature.
    - **Relativistic Speeds:** Capable of approaching the speed of light. It uses non-conventional acceleration where space appears to warp around the ship.
    - **Seamless Hull:** The hull can "dissolve" to create openings.

## Plot So Far

1.  Milo travels from a Martian colony to the remote Terrapin Station to find the legendary sleepwalker, Roberts.
2.  He meets Wilkins, a local trader, who introduces him to the station's culture and agrees to take him to Roberts.
3.  Wilkins leads Milo to the station's observatory, where he finds Roberts floating in silence.
4.  After several days of silent observation, Roberts invites Milo to join him on one of his "walks."
5.  As they head to the ship, Milo is introduced to Echo, Roberts's spherical robot companion, which appears to be a simple, mute device that communicates silently with Wilkins's datapad.
6.  Milo boards the *Wanderer*. Inside the ship, Echo surprises Milo by speaking to him, revealing its true role as Roberts's expressive voice.
7.  The ship departs, demonstrating its silent travel and unique method of acceleration, and the interior wall transforms into a perfect view of space.
8.  **The First Walk:** Roberts takes Milo to the Hecuba Gap, a profoundly empty region of space. Milo learns that the purpose of the "walks" is to find and experience true silence.
9.  **Who Are You:** In a conversation with Echo, Milo learns about the deep-seated mistrust between Earth, the colonies, and the stations. Echo explains that the sleepwalkers trust none of them, viewing their political maneuvering as self-serving "noise."
10. **Encountering Others:** On a second walk, they travel to a Lagrange point and encounter a silent gathering of other sleepwalkers. They receive a message from another sleepwalker.
11. **When Was Then:** The message is a warning from a generation ship, sent decades ago but received only recently. It reveals that the "Wires" (the networked AI) are not serving humanity, but preserving themselves, and have been subtly controlling society for years. This re-contextualizes Roberts's quest for silence as an escape from this silent, machine-led coup.
