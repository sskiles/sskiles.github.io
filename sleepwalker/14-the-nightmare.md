**Log Entry: Cycle 88, Sol 16. Terrapin Station Corridor.**

The simple errand. The final check. My feet touch the station's grimy deck plating. I turn back to the airlock, and the seamless hull of the *Lacuna* is flowing shut. The bottom drops out of my stomach. I raise a hand. "Wait!"

The black hull becomes solid. The ship, my ride, my sanctuary, is now a featureless void. It begins to drift away from the station, silent and unstoppable.

My personal comm crackles to life. A single, clear voice. A voice I've never heard, but I know instantly. It's Roberts.

*"Goodbye, Milo."*

The voice is articulate. Calculated. He could always speak. The shock hits me like a hull breach. I can't breathe.

*"You wanted a real story, Milo,"* the voice continues, the words tearing me up from the inside. *"You just never understood. You weren't meant to write it. You were meant to be it."* There's a pause, and his voice returns, *"Make it a good story."*

Then, Echo's emotionless, but seemingly empathetic tone, a final, serene twist of the knife. *"Sweet dreams."*

The comm dead.

The *Lacuna* a speck. A dying star. Gone.



Bulkhead hits my back. Floor plates cold against my legs. Fumbling for the notebook, need the notebook, need the proof, the log, it has to be...

Gone.

Ripped out.

Nothing left but sketches. Old notes. A stupid caricature of Vance, his face a mocking sneer. My hands won't stop shaking.



"Lost, or just sightseeing?"



Wilkins. The voice a rasp. Pity in it. A hollow sound. The worst sound.



"Roberts..." The name tears my throat. "He left me."



"Roberts?" Empty eyes. No recognition. "Don't know the name, friend." A shrug. He drifts away. Gone too.



Just the corridor. The hum.

My hands. Thin, pale, clutching a book of doodles.

A writer's hands?

I don't know.
