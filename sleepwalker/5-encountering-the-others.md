After our first walk, a routine developed. We would spend a few days docked at Terrapin Station, where Roberts would trade what looked like complex data charts with Wilkins for supplies—water, nutrient paste, and the occasional spare part. Then, without a word, he would lead me back to the *Wanderer*, and we would embark on another silent journey. I had stopped trying to write, and instead had become a student of the silence, learning to appreciate the subtle textures of the void.

Our second walk took us to a different kind of emptiness. We didn't travel to one of the great, empty gaps, but to a Lagrange point, a place of perfect gravitational balance between two large asteroids in the Cybele group. Here, things could collect, caught in the gentle, invisible net of gravity. As we decelerated, the forward screen resolved to show not just stars, but other objects. Other ships.

They were nothing like the sleek corporate vessels or the functional colonial transports I was used to. Like the *Wanderer*, they were unique, cobbled-together creations, each one a reflection of its creator. One looked like a geodesic sphere of crystalline material, glowing faintly with its own internal light. Another was a chaotic jumble of rock and metal, a hollowed-out asteroid that had been given the gift of flight. A third was a long, spindly vessel that resembled the skeleton of some ancient sea creature. There were perhaps a dozen of them, all floating in a loose, silent formation.

This was a gathering of sleepwalkers.

There were no hails, no docking procedures, no flashing communication lights. The ships simply drifted in proximity to one another, a silent community of hermits. It was a strange paradox, a gathering of people who had sought solitude. But I realized it wasn't about socializing; it was about shared presence. It was an acknowledgment that even in their profound isolation, they were not entirely alone. They were a loose confederation of souls who had chosen the same path, and this was their version of a town square.

Roberts guided the *Wanderer* into a place among the other vessels. He didn't look at them, but I felt a sense of... acknowledgment pass between the ships. It was like a fleet of ghosts, each one aware of the others, but respecting the silence that was their common creed. I saw a figure through the crystalline hull of the geodesic ship, a silhouette standing motionless, just as Roberts had stood in the observatory. They were all listening, all bathing in the quiet equilibrium of this place.

For a full day, we floated there. Nothing happened. No one moved. No ships arrived or departed. It was a silent vigil, a shared moment of peace in a place where the universe held its breath. I felt a profound sense of awe. These were the true pioneers of the solar system. Not the miners tearing up moons for profit, or the colonists terraforming worlds in their own image, but these quiet, solitary souls who had sought not to conquer space, but to merge with it.

Then, as if guided by an unseen signal, Roberts turned the *Wanderer* away from the silent fleet. The other ships remained, motionless. There were no goodbyes, no farewells. There was only the silent, mutual understanding of the journey. As the strange, beautiful vessels disappeared from the screen, I knew I had witnessed something extraordinary. I had seen a glimpse of a new kind of human society, one built not on words and commerce, but on silence and distance. And I knew, with a certainty that resonated deep in my bones, that my life back on Mars was a world away, in more ways than one.
