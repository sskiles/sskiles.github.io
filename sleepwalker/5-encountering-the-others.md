After our first walk, a routine developed. We would spend days in the silent void, then return to Terrapin Station, where Roberts would silently trade complex data charts with Wilkins for supplies. Then, without a word, he would lead me back to the *Wanderer*, with Echo floating dutifully at his side, and we would embark on another journey. I had stopped trying to write, and instead had become a student of the silence.

Our second walk took us to a Lagrange point, a place of perfect gravitational balance in the Cybele asteroid group. As we decelerated, the forward wall resolved to show not just stars, but other objects. Other ships. They were unique, cobbled-together creations, each one a reflection of its creator. One looked like a geodesic sphere of glowing crystal; another was a hollowed-out asteroid given the gift of flight.

"Who are they?" I whispered, stunned.

"They are like the Captain," Echo replied, its voice soft. "They are the other sleepwalkers. This is a gathering."

There were no hails, no docking procedures. The dozen or so ships simply drifted in proximity to one another, a silent community of hermits. Roberts guided the *Wanderer* into a place among them.

"It is a strange paradox, isn't it?" Echo mused. "A gathering of people who have sought solitude. But it is not about socializing. It is about shared presence. An acknowledgment that even in their profound isolation, they are not entirely alone."

I saw a figure through the crystalline hull of the geodesic ship, a silhouette standing motionless, just as Roberts stood in the observatory. They were all listening, all bathing in the quiet equilibrium of this place.

"They are a loose confederation of souls who have chosen the same path," Echo explained. "This is their version of a town square. They share data, trade materials, and sometimes, just... float. No words are necessary."

For a full day, we remained. Nothing happened. It was a silent vigil, a shared moment of peace where the universe held its breath. I felt a profound sense of awe. These were the true pioneers, not the miners tearing up moons for profit, but these quiet souls who sought not to conquer space, but to merge with it.

Then, as if guided by an unseen signal, Roberts turned the *Wanderer* away. There were no goodbyes. There was only the silent, mutual understanding of the journey.

"The Captain has traded his sensor data on the Hecuba Gap for the location of a new point of interest from the pilot of the crystalline vessel," Echo informed me as the strange, beautiful ships disappeared from view. "He believes you will find it interesting."

I knew then I had witnessed something extraordinary. A new kind of human society, built not on words and commerce, but on silence and distance. My life back on Mars was a world away, in more ways than one.
