  Welcome to my devblog. 
  This space serves as my digital notebook and a place to share occasional thoughts.
  You will probably find posts on software development, snippits of code, 
  and other random thoughts.
  Take everything you see here with a grain of salt, and don't cite me for anything.
  If I give you a new perspective, or help you solve a problem, I'm glad.
  If you find something that is just plain wrong, let me know.
  Until then, I hope you enjoy your stay.
