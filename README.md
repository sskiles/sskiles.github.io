### Moonwalk Redux
This theme was originally based on 

<a href="https://abhinavs.github.io/moonwalk/">moonwalk</a>  a fast and minimalistic blog theme with clean dark mode.

I really liked the look of the theme, but didn't have any use for most of the features.

If you want to use this theme, check out the original at the link above.

I am a software developer or engineer depending on who you ask. You won't find much 
exciting here, it's mostly just a place for me to store miscellaneous odds and ends. 
I do have some things rattling around that I may release some time, but not now.

I have been a software developer for over 25 years, and I have worked in a variety of
roles and industries. 

Work is work and fun is fun. This is fun.
