Welcome to the site, my name is Shane. I have been a software developer for...
quite a while. I don't write ground breaking or exciting software, but you may 
have run across some of it here and there. I have worked in a variety of companies,
from "mom and pop"s to startups to fortune 50 corporations, in a variety of
roles, in a variety of sectors.
