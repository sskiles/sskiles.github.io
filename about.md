  This site is the personal blog of Shane Skiles. 
  It is a place for me to record and explore my thoughts on varying topics.
  You will probably find posts on software development, snippits of code, 
    and other random thoughts.
  Take everything you see here with a grain of salt, and don't cite me for anything.
  If I give you a new perspective, or help you solve a problem, I'm glad.
  If you find something that is just plain wrong, let me know.
  Until then, I hope you enjoy your stay.
