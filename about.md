Welcome to the site, my name is Shane. I have been a software developer for...
quite a while. I don't write ground breaking or exciting software, but you may 
have run across some of it here and there. 
This space serves as my digital notebook and a place to share occasional thoughts.
You'll find a collection of technical notes, and things I find interesting.
You probably won't see many of my personal projects - most are just one off, 
proof of concept experiments. 

This is more of a digital notebook, a place to tinker with ideas and store 
miscellaneous odds and ends. Have fun looking around, and if you find something useful,
take it and make it your own. 
If you see anything that is flat out wrong, please let me know - 
and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
