Sorry I haven't done anything recently. I had planned on doing a piece on using ```IIncementalGenerator```
to build out a custom ```record``` data layer. Then I realized the generator should target
netstandard2.0... which doesn't have records. Then I thought about doing a piece on creating a 
```record``` out of a ```class```... then I thought about doing a piece on using a polyfill to provide
functionality to an environment that doesn't fully support it. Then I just started slacking.

It happens.
