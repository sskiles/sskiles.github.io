# Project Context: "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker"

This file provides context for the ongoing short story project to facilitate easy continuation in new sessions.

## Project Overview

- **Title:** "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker" (working title)
- **Genre:** Science Fiction
- **Narration:** First-person, from the point of view of Milo.
- **Core Theme:** Exploring concepts of true independence, silence, and existence on the fringes of a hyper-connected society.

## Key Characters

- **Milo:** The protagonist and narrator. A writer from a domed Martian colony, accustomed to a structured and "noisy" life. He is seeking the story of Roberts to write something authentic.
- **Roberts:** The "sleepwalker." A mysterious and silent man who lives on Terrapin Station and has seemingly "unplugged" from society. He communicates non-verbally and pilots the *Wanderer*.
- **Wilkins:** A trader and general mechanic on Terrapin Station. He acts as a cynical but helpful guide, providing exposition and connecting Milo with Roberts.

## The Ship: The *Wanderer*

- **Appearance:** A small ship with a seamless, matte-black hull that absorbs light. It has no visible viewports, hatches, or propulsion systems.
- **Interior:** A single, ovoid chamber with white, light-emitting walls. Surgically clean and minimalist.
- **Abilities:**
    - **Silent Operation:** Makes no sound and has no heat signature.
    - **FTL Travel:** Capable of instantaneous "jumps" and non-conventional acceleration where space appears to warp around the ship.
    - **Seamless Hull:** The hull can "dissolve" to create openings.

## Plot So Far

4.  After several days of silent observation, Roberts invites Milo to join him on one of his "walks."
5.  Wilkins shows Milo to Roberts's ship, the *Wanderer*, explaining its mysterious nature.
6.  Milo boards the *Wanderer*. The interior is unnervingly clean and minimalist.
7.  The ship departs, demonstrating its silent, instantaneous travel and unique method of acceleration.
