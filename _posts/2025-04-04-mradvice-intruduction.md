I recently ran across a nice project here on GitHub also available via NuGet for 
implementing aspect oriented programming (AOP) in C#. Let me introduce you to the wonderful 
world of <a href="https://github.com/ArxOne/MrAdvice">MrAdvice</a>. It is an open-source 
alternative to PostSharp's <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/metalama">metalama</a>, 
which is a commercial AOP framework for .NET.
