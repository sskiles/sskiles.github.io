I mentiond some time back that I had recently purchased an ESP32-C6 
microcontroller to play around with. 
My goal, with the microcontrollers is to up my C/C++ game and have fun 
(mostly have fun). I would really like to build a 
[micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) some day.
I'm sure that's not going to happen, but it's a thought.

In the meantime, I startted picking up Python/Micropython. 
That is much more in demand these days. I'm getting used to it.
At first, the entire white space for flow control killed me.
It's kind of growing on me (I don't look at it and scream "insanity" anymore).

There is a nifty little library named Microdot that is a Micropython web framework.
It is supposed to be inspired by Flask, but I have no idea of how accurate that is.
Anyway, I started building a little web app that I totally ended up over engineering.
It was going to just be a little "hello world" with some device information thrown in.
That's not how it ended up.
