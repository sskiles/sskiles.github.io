Whenever people complain about Google search results related to ads or AI, I always point them to 
[&udm14](https://udm14.com/). This is a shortcut to 
[https://www.google.com/?udm=14](https://www.google.com/?udm=14). Google has UDM codes commonly associated with the Unified Data Model's structured format for Google Security Operations.
However, for the purposes of this discussion, these UDM codes are rumored to stand for User Display Modes. 
Searching Google with "udm=14" displays only organic results with 
no ads, 
no AI summaries, 
no geolocation suggestions,
no contact info... 
just results.
As it shows only organic results, this is an invaluable tool for SEO purposes.

For me, it is a nice refreshing way to look at Google every now and then. I don't use it all of the time. 
I actually don't mind the AI results. I won't go into the debates regarding the 
ethical implications, effects on content creators, accuracy, or other issues with AI summaries.
If the first two sentences of the summary answer my question, I have no problem with that.
Of course, any question of any consequence will be researched further. 

And I usually don't mind ads too much. It helps me "ground" the results outside of my mindset.
What are people selling with this? 
Classes to learn more? 
Competing products/services?
Services using the product?
Sometimes I encounter clever ideas in ads that make me realize 
people are using this product/service/technology in a way I'd never considered.

Anyway, back to the topic at hand. The "udm=14" flag is a very handy trick to remember 
or bookmark to keep handy. One could set that as your default search page 
and never think about it again. I'm writing about it here to tell you about it and to make it easier for me to find on other people's systems. 
I can never remember "udm", "utm", 14, 15, etc. One might expect "Google disenshitification"
to be the top search result, but it isn't.

There are other "udm" codes hiding in the shadows (I haven't found a list of codes anywhere).
This might be the most complete list of codes I've been able to compile anywhere.
- udm=6 - Adds in a Q&A section
- udm=7 - Only videos
- udm=8 - Jobs
- udm=12 - News
- udm=14 - Results only
- udm=15 - Attractions

There may be other codes that do other things, this was a list I compiled through recent experimentation. Hopefully, you can add this tool to your collection.
