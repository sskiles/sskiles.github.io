Whenever people complain about Google results regarding ads or AI results, I always point them to 
[&udm14](https://udm14.com/). This is a shortcut to 
[https://www.google.com/?udm=14](https://www.google.com/?udm=14). Google has UDM codes which are 
most commonly associated with Unified Data Model structured format for Google Security Operations.
However, for the purposes here, these UDM codes are rumored to stand for User Display Modes. 
Searching Google with "udm=14" displays only organic results with 
no ads, 
no AI summaries, 
no geolocation suggestions,
no contact info... 
just results.
Since it is only organic results, this is an invaluable tool for SEO purposes.

For me, it is a nice refreshing way to look at Google every now and then. I don't use it all of the time. 
I actually don't mind the AI results. I won't go into the debates regarding the 
ethical implications, effects on content creators, accuracy, or other issues with AI summaries.
If the first 2 sentences of the summary answer my question, I have no problem with that.
Of course, any question of any consequence is going to be researched further. 

And I usually don't mind ads too much. It helps me "ground" the results outside of my mindset.
What are people selling with this? 
Classes to learn more? 
Competing products/services?
Services using the product?
Sometimes I run across ideas in ads that are really clever and make me realize 
people are using this product/service/technology in a way I'd never considered.

Anyway, back to the topic at hand. The "udm=14" flag is a very handy trick to remember 
or bookmark to keep handy. I guess you could probably set that as your default search page 
and never think about it again. I'm writing about it here to tell you about it and to make it easier for me to find on other people's systems. 
I can never remember "udm", "utm", 14, 15, etc.. You would think "Google disenshitification"
would make it the first hit, but it doesn't.

There are other "udm" codes hiding in the shadows (I haven't found a list of codes anywhere).
There is a chance this is the most complete list of codes I've been able to compile anywhere.
- udm=6 - Adds in a Q&A section
- udm=7 - Only videos
- udm=8 - Jobs
- udm=12 - News
- udm=14 - Results only
- udm=15 - Attractions

There may be other codes that do other things, this was just a list I put 
together experimenting just now. Hopefully, this is another tool you can add to your collection.
