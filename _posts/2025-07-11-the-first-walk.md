Our first "walk" was a journey into the heart of silence. The *Wanderer* moved with a purpose that felt less like navigation and more like a form of meditation. The forward view was a constantly shifting tapestry of distorted starlight, the universe bending around us. There was no sense of time in the conventional way; hours could have been minutes, or minutes days. My own internal clock, so used to the rigid 24.7-hour cycle of Mars, was hopelessly lost. I was untethered not just from gravity, but from time itself.

Roberts never spoke. He remained in his harness, eyes closed for long stretches, a picture of perfect tranquility. Occasionally, he would open them and make a minute adjustment to our course, not with a console, but with a simple, almost imperceptible gesture. A slight turn of his hand, and the starfield would ripple, our trajectory altering in ways that defied my understanding of orbital mechanics. He was connected to this vessel on a level that transcended technology; he didn't fly the *Wanderer*, he danced with it.

I tried to write. I unstrapped myself, the soft light of the cabin making the screen of my datapad seem harsh and intrusive. I wanted to capture the feeling, the impossible sensation of movement without momentum, of speed without wind. But my words felt clumsy, inadequate. How do you describe a color that has no name? How do you explain a sound that is the absence of all sound? My vocabulary, honed in a world of concrete sensations, was useless here. I was a fish trying to describe the sky.

Frustrated, I put the datapad away. I decided to simply observe, to be present in the moment. I watched Roberts. I watched the silent, flowing cosmos. I began to notice the subtleties of our journey. We weren't just moving from Point A to Point B. We were drifting on currents I couldn't see, weaving through unseen gravitational tides. Roberts was a master navigator of this hidden ocean, his destination not a place, but a state of being. He was seeking out the quietest corners of the solar system, the places where the background noise of the universe was at its faintest.

After an immeasurable period, the ship began to slow. The distorted starlight on the forward screen resolved back into sharp, familiar pinpricks. We had arrived. We were floating in the middle of the Hecuba Gap, one of the largest of the Kirkwood Gaps. It was a vast, empty expanse, a celestial desert where the gravitational resonance of Jupiter had flung all but the most stubborn rocks into other orbits. It was profoundly, beautifully empty.

Roberts unstrapped himself and floated to the center of the chamber. He closed his eyes, and for a full hour, he simply hung there, perfectly still. He wasn't asleep; I could sense a deep, focused awareness in him. He was listening, not with his ears, but with his entire being. He was bathing in the silence, soaking in the profound peace of this empty place. I realized then that this was the purpose of the walk. It wasn't about the destination; it was about the journey *to* the destination. It was about finding the last few places where one could truly be alone, where the incessant chatter of the inhabited worlds faded to nothing. It was a pilgrimage to the heart of nowhere.
