The dream of the 20 watt sleepwalker...

That my working title for a short story I'm working on for 
"Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine". I have a few ideas I want to get in there,
but I may need to break it up into a few different stories. I would like to
set it a few hundred years in the future, lunar and Martian colonies, the Earth
suffering from the Kessler Effect, and manned missions for exploration and mining
around the solar system. 

One problem I'm having trouble with is the technology.

Part of the backstory is that people want to live in space, not on Earth or
the colonies. If they do ever end up on Earth or the colonies, it is unlikely they
will ever be able to return to space. They are the sleepwalkers.
 
There is distrust amongst the government, the corporations, the colonies,
and the sleepwalkers. All of them have their own agendas, and all of them
are trying to manipulate the others. Any communication between them is
filtered through layers of bureaucracy, propaganda, and misinformation.
Anyone of them could be the enemy, or all of them.

...The government wants to control the colonies,
the corporations want to control the government, the colonies want to control
the sleepwalkers, and the sleepwalkers want to be left alone.
The sleepwalkers are the ones who have the most freedom, but they are also
the most vulnerable. They are the ones who are most likely to be manipulated,
and they are the ones who are most likely to be used as pawns in the game of
power. The government, the corporations, and the colonies all want to use
the sleepwalkers to achieve their own goals. The sleepwalkers are the ones who
are most likely to be sacrificed in the name of progress. They are the ones
who are most likely to be used as cannon fodder in the war for control of the
solar system. The sleepwalkers are the ones who are most likely to be left behind
when the dust settles. They are the ones who are most likely to be forgotten.
