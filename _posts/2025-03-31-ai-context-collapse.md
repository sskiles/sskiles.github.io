AI Context Collapse

This will be our starting point for this post. I’m not sure where it will go, but it’s starting here.

I know I'm a little late to the show in saying "AI is here!" but yet, here we are. 

I always thought AI would stay in more of a machine learning and data science niche, something bubbling up search recommendations or quietly optimizing the minutiae of rocket science. But instead, it has slowly worked its way into our lives. It has gone from being a passer-by offering advice in the background of some movie to a recurring character in our daily lives and conversations.

*^^^More on this ^^^*

When the internet started gaining popularity in the 1990's it helped facilitate communications between individuals, whether colleagues, family or strangers. This ability to collaborate, exchange ideas, engage in virtual communities revolutionized the way the connected, learned and worked.

what are the consequences of blurring the lines between people and opinionated line noise?




What we’re seeing now isn’t collapsing the context and content it’s a reshaping of context and content itself. 

The lines between original and generated, expert and amateur, real and synthetic are blurring fast. 

It’s that it can do so in ways that absorb and remix vast amounts of human-created content — and that this output often gets consumed without any clear context of where it came from or how it was made.

 We’re losing the metadata that used to help us understand the *why*, *how*, and *who* behind the things we see and read online. Was this written by a human? Was it AI-assisted? Was it trained on something that was ethically sourced? Was it even *true*?

So I guess the question from here is do we need to or can we rebuild new kinds of context in an AI-saturated world? 


...AI context collapse is not just about the technology itself, but about the ...implications that come with it.

So, where do we go from here? Do we ... pause and reflect ... consequences ... uncertain ... complexities 

I don’t have the answers yet. But that’s where my mind is today.
