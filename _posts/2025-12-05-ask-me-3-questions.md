I recently started using a new method of working with LLMs. 
This method has proven surprisingly effective and useful. 
I describe my task or objective, then end the prompt with "Ask me 3 questions."
It could be three or five questions, or any other number. Give it a number. 
If the request is open-ended, with no number, 
it may ignore you and jump in to modifying files immediately.

I used to sometimes end prompts with "what do you think?" when brainstorming ideas.
That was always the cue to start making changes, which I often found frustrating. 

Now, "ask me 3 questions" is my standard ending to almost any prompt.
It provides insight into how well the LLM understands the concept 
of what you are trying to accomplish.
It helps clarify details that may have been glossed over in the prompt.
Sometimes it offers ideas to expand on the original concept.
Sometimes it helps you solidify the concept in you own mind.
And sometimes, it makes you realize you need to rethink what you are trying to do completely.

There's nothing like an LLM asking if you're sure you want to do apple things to oranges
to make you realize it's time to take a break. A reality check from an AI.
Step away from the keyboard and regroup
