I recently started using a new method of working with LLMs. 
It has been surprisingly effective and useful. 
I'll go ahead and describe my task or objective, then end the prompt with "ask me 3 questions."
It could be 3 questions, or 5 questions, whatever. Give it a number. 
If you make it open ended, with no number, 
it may ignore you and jump in to modifying files immediately.

I used to sometimes end prompts with "what do you think?" when brainstorming ideas.
That was always the go ahead to start making changes as far as my AI of the day thought.
That always annoyed me and I couldn't help myself. 

Now, "ask me 3 questions" is my standard ending to almost any prompt.
It gives you a good idea, of how well the LLM understands the concept 
of what you are trying to accomplish.
It helps clarify details that may have been glossed over in the prompt.
Sometimes it gives you ideas to expand on the original concept.
Sometimes it helps you solidify the concept in you own mind.
And sometimes, it makes you realize you need to rethink what you are trying to do completely.

There's nothing like an LLM asking if you're sure you want to do apple things to oranges
to make you realize it's time to take a break. A reality check from an AI.
Step away from the keyboard and regroup
