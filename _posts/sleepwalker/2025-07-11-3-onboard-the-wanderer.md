The moment I passed through the circular opening, the matte-black material of the hull flowed silently back into place behind me, sealing with a seamless perfection that left no trace of a door. The transition was instantaneous and absolute. One moment I was in the dusty, metallic-smelling cargo bay of Terrapin Station; the next, I was enveloped in a soft, uniform, sourceless light. The oppressive hum of the station's life support was gone, replaced by a silence so profound it felt like a physical presence. It wasn't the dead silence of a vacuum, but the clean, crisp silence of a place perfectly ordered.

The air was the first thing that truly struck me. I took a breath and it was like drinking pure, cold water. It was utterly neutral, devoid of the familiar scents of recycled air—the ozone, the oil, the faint, ever-present smell of too many people in too small a space. It was so clean that for the first time in my life, I became aware of my own scent. I could smell the faint odor of the nutrient paste I'd had for breakfast, the synthetic fibers of my clothes, the sweat on my skin. In this surgically clean environment, I was the contaminant, a messy, organic anomaly. I suddenly felt grubby and self-conscious.

The interior of the *Wanderer* was a single, ovoid chamber, larger than it had any right to be based on its external dimensions. The walls were the same soft, light-emitting white as the air, with no visible seams or panels. It was the epitome of minimalism, yet it didn't feel cold or sterile. It felt... calm. Against one wall was a simple cot, its blanket folded with geometric precision. A small, integrated console showed what I assumed were environmental readings, all perfectly stable. There was no clutter, no personal effects, save for a single, worn book placed squarely on the cot.

Roberts floated past me, his movements economical and serene. He gestured towards a recessed compartment in the wall, which slid open at his touch. It was clearly meant for a passenger. Inside was a simple harness system. He then pointed to a second, identical compartment on the opposite side of the chamber. This was his. There were no complex controls, no banks of switches or frantic readouts. The entire forward section of the chamber was a smooth, featureless wall that I suspected was some kind of viewscreen, though it was currently as blank and white as the rest of the interior.

I stowed my small pack and secured myself in the harness, feeling clumsy and out of place. Roberts settled into his own harness, his posture relaxed, as if he were merely sitting down in a comfortable chair. He didn't touch a console or issue a command. He simply closed his eyes. For a long moment, nothing happened. I could feel the faint vibration of the station's magnetic clamps through the hull, and then, even that ceased. We were adrift.

I watched the blank forward wall, expecting it to flicker to life with an external view. It remained white. There was no jolt of acceleration, no hum of a drive kicking in. But I knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that we were moving. I felt a strange, internal lurch, a sense of dislocation, as if the universe had shifted around us, rather than us moving through it. It wasn't a physical sensation of G-force; it was a cognitive one, a direct perception of motion without any of the expected physical cues.

Roberts opened his eyes and gestured towards the wall. As if on cue, the whiteness dissolved, replaced by a perfect, crystal-clear view of space. But it wasn't the view I expected. Terrapin Station wasn't receding behind us; it was simply *gone*. In its place was a vast, empty starfield, the constellations subtly but noticeably altered. We hadn't just moved; we had jumped, covering an impossible distance in the span of a single, silent moment.

The acceleration, when it came, was just as unnerving. The stars didn't streak or blur. The pinpricks of light remained sharp and clear. But the space between them began to contract, the patterns shifting and warping as if we were falling through the very fabric of spacetime. There was no vibration, no sound, only this silent, relentless rush through a cosmos that was being redrawn around us second by second. I gripped my harness, my knuckles white, my writer's mind scrambling for a metaphor, a description, for something so profoundly alien. I was no longer just a passenger; I was a witness to a new kind of physics, a new kind of dream. And as I looked at Roberts, floating calmly in his harness, a single, terrifying, exhilarating thought echoed in my mind: this is his normal.
