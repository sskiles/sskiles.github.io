I try not to be too pro or anti AI, but it's not going away, and it's becoming 
unavoidable in the software development world. 


If programmers of any skill level can use AI to 
help them code, 
help them be more productive, 
help them learn, 
help them find solutions to problems,
then I think that is a good thing.
